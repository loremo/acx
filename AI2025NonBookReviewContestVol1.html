After a routine camera pan of miscellaneous dignitaries viewing a military parade, a &#39;creature&#39; appeared at the head of one of the marching units. I was stunned and began a deep dive into the story of this &#39;creature&#39; who turned out to be Taffy IV, the goat mascot of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, in his full military regalia, green cape and all. The deep dive went deeper: Taffy was a war hero.

Images of the Ibex, as prey, are found in ancient cave paintings and in archeological sites as early as 64,000 years ago. As herbivores there is no danger that a hungry goat will kill and eat a human. [4] It does not compete with humans for food. Being smallish in size, an individual person could wrangle and partially train them. [5] They require less work than other livestock who are often picky eaters. [6] Goats also reproduce in captivity thereby insuring food for the future. They are a reliable source of meat. &#39;Forget the special grass, Kevin, just eat the sheep!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.cszf4xn6dzib"><span class="c9">LESSON 2: GRASS CAN BECOME MILK.</span><span class="c25 c39">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Humans cannot digest most grasses, seeds and woody plants in an unprocessed form: it makes them sick! As ruminants [7] goats are able to provide regular milk because they process the grasses into milk. Domestication of the goat in the Fertile Crescent dates back 10,000 years, at about the same time as truly domesticated strains of grasses and grain crops emerged [8] The new abundance of grasses at the end of the last Ice Age did not directly result in an increase of food for humanity, but it did feed &#39;farm stock&#39;, who in turn fed people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Perhaps the second age of humanity could be called the &#39;Age of Cooking&#39; rather than the &#39;agricultural age&#39; because the new and most important element in human society became the processing of &#39;raw&#39; materials rather than simply hunting and gathering. The use of fire for cooking and the availability of milk from ruminants brought the abundance of the warmer climate into the homes of humanity [9]. Thus, the goat helped to save humanity from the cold, sparse, desperate and often dangerous conditions of life during the Ice Ages.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.1wh0oouw1kvn"><span class="c25 c39">LESSON 3: BE ORGANIZED.</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">As the planet settled into a warmer and more certain environment, humans began to shift to a commercial society and the role of the goat shifted. [10] Hunter-gatherers had to become farmers and cooks in order to benefit directly from the changing world. Commerce, rather than surviving the cold, became the main driving force as humanity changed from a migratory life into the settled grouping of civilization. [11] Stores of grain had to be measured and protected. Herds had to be counted and contained. Early humans then had to become accountants and governors. [12]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">But, what happened to the goat? The goat itself remained important for a single family. In the family setting the goat was small enough to live in the squeezed homestead of urbanized life and still provide a reliable supply of milk and meat. [13] Goats also found a place for themselves when humans sold or exchanged food becoming a &#39;product&#39; in commerce: providing extra milk and milk products which could be sold or exchanged when it was alive; and providing meat and hides to sell when it was dead. The goat became simply another an item in humanity&#39;s inventory</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">Commercial life started as a simple exchange system known as the baba system. [14] Six thousand years ago the Sumerian city-state of Lagash taxed transactions by farmers, cattle breeders, artisans, hunters and merchants by taking part of the income received in &#39;kind&#39;, by conscription, by construction of temples and canals and other exchanges. Goats were an integral part of that system: In the </span><span class="c9 c14">Bible</span><span class="c25 c9">, for example, Jacob, took speckled, spotted or black sheep and goats as wages and then carefully bred his flocks to become large and sturdy making himself extremely rich. [15]Joseph , a son of Jacob, was chosen by the Egyptian Pharaoh to be his chancellor.[16] He exchanged bread for livestock for his family when there was no money left to buy bread in the lands of Egypt and Cannan [17] Later Joseph acquired the lands of his tribe, who worked the land as surfs and were permitted to keep most of the harvest, providing them with some property rights. They became fruitful and increased in numbers [18] Nomadic wealth was measured by the size of the goat herd owned by one family or tribe.[19]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Along with excess, society developed and supported specialized individuals such as priests, artists, and kings who no longer produced their own food. Goat meat was placed among the benefits accorded to priests &#39;Offerings can be an animal from either herd or flock...if the offering is an animal out of a flock, a lamb or a goat offered as a holocaust, is a male without blemish.&#39;[20] Sacrifices for Sin provide a way to be forgiven for certain sins. Sins of priests and leaders of the community require the sacrifice of a bull. Sins of private individuals require sacrifice of a she-goat or female lamb. The offering is an atonement for the inadvertent sin or doing something forbidden by the commandments of Yahweh. If the person cannot afford an animal of the flock, two turtledoves or young pigeons will substitute: one for a sacrifice for sin and one for a burned offering. And if that cannot be afforded, then a bushel sized figurine of wheat flour, mixed with oil or incense can be substituted as a memorial.[21] In the hierarchy of sacrifices, the sacrificed goat is sufficient for some sins of individuals but the sins of leaders and priests require beef. In these ways the goat retained a codified significance within that exchange system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Outside of the commercial world, the goat regularly appeared in religious hierarchies and systems [22], but never as the leader. The goat was always relegated to a second level of importance appearing as servants of the gods occasionally having some specific but limited magical powers. Some examples include Agni, the Vedic fire god, rode on goats and used them to pull his chariot through the sky. The Norse god, Thor, possessed a magical chariot pulled by two goats named Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjo&#769;str. They were killed and eaten daily but returned to life when the chariot was needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Another Norse goat, Hedendom, lived on the roof of Odin&#39;s palace, where he ate leaves from the Tree of Life and produced a constant stream of mead for the warriors. Amalthea, a nymph, who is often described as a goat nursed the infant Zeus on her milk. Her horn, known as the cornucopia, was a magical horn capable of producing endless amounts of food or drink. Her goat skin was part of her shield and was used as a weapon in Zeus&#39;s battle against the Titans. She was rewarded by becoming a constellation in the sky but not a goddess. Pan, a satyr who is a half-man, half-goat creature was so hideous that his mother and nurse abandoned him. His father, Zeus, took him to Mt. Olympus where he became a favorite of the gods. He also referred to as the son of Hermes and as the god of shepherds, hunters and the wilds of nature. As the wild goat he symbolized strength and unpredictability. But as a satyr he was not part of the higher court on Olympus. The goat was an only attribute of Marduk, the Sumerian god who created heaven and earth. [23]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">In the Old Testament </span><span class="c9 c14">Bible </span><span class="c25 c9">the goat had some limited magical powers as a scapegoat. [24] Yahweh added the requirements of the Great Day of Atonement requiring that requiring that Aaron should receive two goats for a sacrifice for his own sin and a ram for a holocaust for atonement for himself and his family. Aaron allotted one goat to Yahweh and the other to Azazel [the demon of the desert]. The goat for Yahweh is sacrificed in the rite of atonement of sin. The other goat is sent into the desert to Azazel. Aaron, while laying his hands on the head of the second goat, confesses all the faults of the sons of Israel and lays them to its charge. The goat bore all of their faults away with it into the desert. The sacrifice of a goat became a substitute for human sacrifice. Abraham, who was singled out by Yahweh to form a great nation with all the nations of the earth, to command his sons and to maintain the way of Yahweh by just and upright living was tested for loyalty and passed because he was willing to kill and burn his son as a show of loyalty. An angel revealed a goat hanging in a nearby bush who was acceptable as a substitute for the boy. &ldquo;Because you have done this, you have not refused me your son, your only son, I will shower blessings on you. I will make your descendants as many as the stars of heaven and the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants shall gain possession of the gates of their enemies. All nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, as a reward for your obedience.&rdquo; [245</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Although these goats had essential and important tasks in the more organized human society, the goat&#39;s basic position as </span><span class="c9 c14">livestock </span><span class="c25 c9">did not change. Humanity learned to &#39;use&#39; the goat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.afoew7tu3zsa"><span class="c25 c39">LESSON 4: BE CURIOUS!</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Accumulating more and more is an easy, if repetitive and boring, endeavor. Although humans are reassured by classification [256] they also like to explore their environs and will incorporate new food into their diets. Perhaps the efficient browsing behavior which helps goats survive in extreme climates is a precursor to curiosity. Curiosity, defined as a strong desire to know or to learn something more than is necessary for our immediate foreseeable needs, is more than simple mimicry. Is curiosity acquired in childhood or is it given in some inherited form? This question continues to be pondered to this day. [27] It could also be learned or reinforced by observation of other species such as the friendly and productive goat. After humans were nourished by and began to sell the goat and its products as part of commerce, they began to comment on the importance of the inquisitive nature of the goat not just its role as a product or servant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Aristotle, commented that &#39;with goats, the shepherds appointed no bell-weather [a ram trained by a shepherd to lead the flock] as the animal is not capable of repose, but is frisky and apt to ramble.&#39; [28] That interest in exploring (or curiosity) cannot be fully tamed, although curiosity can advance civilization even after the basic needs are sated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The curiosity of the goat has contributed to its own survivability in harsh environments. It brought new items to the community table for its own species and for humanity. The groups of goats that try out different grasses and grains survive better than those groups that stagnate. When the &#39;Flock Queen&#39; comes upon a plant that is poisonous or inedible, she will sniff the plant and then snort and show obvious dislike for it. All the goats in the herd will take turns smelling the same plant, using its scent as identification of that particular plant. After they have all taken a turn memorizing the plant&rsquo;s odor, the &#39;Top Buck&#39; will trample the plant. [29] The &#39;fittest&#39; species are those that can adapt to a changing environment, not just those which are the &#39;strongest&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">As need for organization on a large scale emerged keeping track of supplies and inventory fundamentally changed the way humans had to think.. This change from simple to complex thought has been described as the origin of consciousness. [30] The early mind consisted of non-conscious thought that could not reason or articulate why one did something. The structure of the government had become so complicated that the king&#39;s singular thoughts were heard as fourteen different voices. One clear mind could not cope with larger societies. One farmer can keep track of one or ten buckets of milk but not hundreds. Humanity had to think beyond the facts before it to operate the complicated system it was creating. Curiosity was among humanity&#39;s steps into the complex mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">However, rather than being lauded for its curiosity, the goat is often ridiculed for it. For a long time, goats were depicted eating tin cans in cartoons and comics . In actuality, the goat is often seen exploring a can for something tasty and rarely actually &#39;eats&#39; the can. [31] Continual &#39;exploration&#39; and willingness to consume a variety of items as food is how the goat can survive and even thrive in rough environments where other ruminants die. Rather than praising the goat for its curious nature, the tin can reference is one of ridicule coupled with a suggestion of danger. &#39;Curiosity kills the cat&#39; is a maxim warning humans about the dangers of questioning the status quo. Part of being curious is being able to doubt what has been taught and repeated by society.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Humans are often warned against being curious beyond the strictures of their society or religion. Eve caused the ruination of humanity because she ate an apple, a tasty and healthy fruit forbidden by her god. [32] Epimetheus, a brother of Prometheous, was given a jar containing all manner of misery and evil and was warned by his brother not to open it.. Zeus, who was determined to counteract the blessing of fire stolen by Prometheous, created Pandora and sent her to marry Epimetheus. Pandora opened the jar and many evils flew out over the earth. Hope alone remained inside, the lid having been shut down before she could escape. In a later story the jar contained not evils but blessings, which would have been preserved for the </span><span class="c9 c102">human race </span><span class="c9">had they not been lost through the opening of the jar out of </span><span class="c9 c102">curiosity</span><span class="c25 c9">. [32] These stories emphasize the dangers of being curious rather than the marvels that sometimes appear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Things can worsen for the goat because of its inability to stay in line. The goat who saved the village from diseases, curses or sins as its scapegoat and who did not do anything evil or reprehensible except that it did not do everything for its god, was transformed into an unworthy being by the King of heaven in the famous &#39;sheep to the right; goats to the left speech&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">45 &ldquo;He will reply, &lsquo;Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.&rsquo;<br> </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">46 &ldquo;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c25 c9">-&ndash; &nbsp;Matthew 24: 31-46 The Sermon on the End.

A goat prancing down the aisle to be crowned as leader would be as likely to veer away to sniff and munch on some nearby tender nearby grass as he would be to march solemnly to the altar. He could lose the crown but discover parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.u8wo1c42rrus"><span class="c25 c39">LESSON 5: RUMINATE!</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">After a goat has eaten its fill of grass it lies down and ruminates. This is the amazing, if somewhat gross, process of chewing grass, swallowing it into one stomach, regurgitating it as cud, chewing it again and sending it into another stomach for final processing into milk. [35] Humans often nap after dinner and sometimes ruminate. But they are doing something completely different from the goat. Rumination is the last lesson.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Even the great </span><span class="c9 c14">Oxford English Dictionary </span><span class="c25 c9">can not decide which is the &#39;first&#39; meaning of ruminate! &#39;Ruminant&#39; is (a) an animal who chews cud first, (b) a contemplative person. &#39;Rumination&#39; is (a) contemplation and (b) the action of chewing cud. [36] This dual meaning links the goat&#39;s ability to provide milk with human imagination. The word is the same yet it is different. [37] When humans ruminate they think deeply about something. Thinking can be worrying, problem solving, envisioning new possibilities, explaining different perspectives, or imagining new ideas. Imagination, however, is more than curiosity because it surpasses the real. [38]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">When imagination enters the frame, storytelling changes away from the mere recitation of facts The &#39;Queen&#39; goat identifies and communicates information about a new and unpleasant grass to the herd. She does not tell a story. Animals can &#39;lie&#39; when they communicate with each other. For example, when the possum pretends to be dead it is acting out of instinct not creativity [39] This is where the student (humanity) surpasses Campbell&#39;s tutor (animals).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">In human tales, the goat often becomes a character or vehicle of the imagination. Some wonderful ruminations, better referred to as stories, include goats or part-goat/part-something else creatures. In these tales the &#39;perfect livestock&#39; is a figure within the trickster mythology: stories that make others see something in a new and different way. The servant goat becomes a doorway between the wilds of nature and the elegance of civilization. He is the character in myth who threatens to take the myth apart. [40]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">For example a Greek and Roman mythic character is Pan, [41] the god of the wild, nature, sexuality and shepherds, who is a half-man/half-goat creature. He teases, deceives, tricks and pushes the other gods, humans and even plants and animals out of their traditional selves and roles. He could transform objects into different forms. He causes the sudden, irrational fear in humans, known as &#39;panic&#39;.<br> Some myths say that Pan was a son of the god Hermes; others name Zeus as the father. In either case they created an offspring who is both ugly and attractive; not all human but not all animal, but with some magical powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Pan is usually introduced as an odd, but attractive, benign creature who frolics in the woods, dances with glee and plays music on a reed pipe in a grand Bacchanalia, or party. But the story does not end there. The pipe he uses was made from reeds which were formed by several water nymphs to hide their sister wood nymph Syrnix from rape by Pan. He then cut the reeds into pieces to form the pipe which he used to lure others into the woods. Pan changes from a sweet faun into a monster and recasts the myth from something charming into a horror story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Peter Pan is a fictional character created by J.M. Barrie in 1902. The first illustration in Peter Pan is of the naked child riding on a goat. [42]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">&#39;If you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl, she will say &ldquo;Why, of course I did, child&rdquo;; and if you ask her whether he rode a goat in those days, she will say, &ldquo;What a foolish question to ask; certainly he did.&rdquo; [43]<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The book regularly links Peter to the god Pan. They both bring children into the wild forest and Kensington Garden to frolic and have scary adventures. Peter himself, made the pipes from reeds to sing &#39;just as the birds sing for joy&#39; But he did not simply entertain the birds, he played the pipes to confuse the birds and to cheat the trees into blooming early.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">&#39;Peter&rsquo;s heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long, just as the birds sing for joy, but, being partly human, he needed an instrument, so he made a pipe of reeds, and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening, practicing the sound of the wind and the ripple of the water, and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon, and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived, and they would say to each other, &lsquo;Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe?&rsquo; And sometimes he played the birth of birds, and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg. If you are a child of the Gardens ,you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge, which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts, but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way. It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the chestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.&#39; [44]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Peter has many daring adventures in the 1904 play </span><span class="c9 c14">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#39;t Grow Up. </span><span class="c25 c9">[45] Many of the adventures in the wild are dangerous, scary and cause panic. Peter shoots Wendy with a bow and arrow. Wendy and her brothers are captured by pirates and almost die. Captain Hook is determined to kill Peter because Peter cut off one of his arms in a duel, and fed the arm to the crocodile who found the arm to be tasty and wants to kill Hook to finish the meal. Like the great god Pan, Peter Pan initially promises fun and adventure but the fun usually turns into danger and nastiness. The children eventually want to go home to a stable, warm and loving home, but Peter remains in Neverland betwixt and between civilization and the wild...like the untamable goat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Other well known stories include goats.

[46] Muriel, a white goat, is one of the few fully literate animals in </span><span class="c9 c14">Animal Farm</span><span class="c9">. [47] Tumnus, a character in the </span><span class="c9 c14">Chronicles of Narnia, </span><span class="c25 c9">has reddish skin, curly hair, brown eyes, a short pointed beard, horns on his forehead, cloven hooves, goat legs with glossy black hair, a &#39;strange but pleasant little face,&#39; a long tail, and being &#39;only a little taller than Lucy herself.&#39; [48] Other tales include the Swedish Yule Goat, Krampus of the Alpine regions, and the goat figures found in the western and Chinese astrology. Even the noted author and journalist John Steinbeck changed his assignment for the Daily Express away from reporting on the airplanes of the Royal Air Force at Manston Airfield. Instead, he wrote an entire column about the mascot, Wing Commander William de Goat D.S.O who munched cigarettes, ate nearly everything in sight especially beer and glycol cooling fluid and who was considered to be the luck of his wing [49]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">In these stories, the goat character changes reality within the story and makes the reader see something unexpected. This is the essence of the Trickster archetype. &#39;He is the archetype who attacks all archetypes. He tells the story and then threatens to tear it apart. He is an eternal state of mind that is suspicious of all eternals, dragging them from their heavenly preserves to see how they fare down here in this time-haunted world &#39; [50] Imagination, aka creative lying, is the one of the most important element distinguishing humanity from all of the other species.

The goat is important to humanity as the creature who tried new food when other livestock would rather die; as a creature who adapted to a wholly new situation of urban life and survived; and as a creature who is always curious. The very curiosity that helped to save humanity from extinction in the Ice Ages became the reason for its damnation to hell. The student who discovers that something can be both attractive and dangerous at the same time awakens to the &#39;dilemma of curiosity&#39;.

Similar to how you&rsquo;d start running for the first time, you start gymnastics with skills, drills, and basics that are appropriate to whatever your fitness and capability levels are right now, and those exist even for very very beginner level adults. Good adult coaches can meet you where you&rsquo;re at, even if where you&rsquo;re at is face down on the mat. I&rsquo;ve taught beginner classes to people who have literally never done a sport in their lives, and they left the class in one piece, with a smile on their face, and a desire for more (and to be fair also a fair amount of sweat and soreness).</span></p><h2 class="c97 c79" id="h.8t26gsq6hea"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">CrossFit, But With Less Cult and More Flips</span></h2><p class="c65"><span class="c3">The specialized nature of most physical activities creates what you might call &quot;fitness asymmetries.&quot; Runners develop impressive cardiovascular capacity but often neglect upper body strength. Weightlifters build impressive force production but may lack mobility. Rock climbers develop grip strength that would make a gorilla jealous but might have comparatively underdeveloped lower bodies. But gymnastics really does use pretty much every muscle in your body. The sheer variety of movements and loads you need to master if you&rsquo;re training all 8 different apparatus (across all the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s events) is pretty unmatched across other physical activities I&rsquo;m aware of. The phrase &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sore in places I didn&rsquo;t even know I had muscles&rdquo; is not uncommon in the gymnastics gym! And while gymnastics doesn&rsquo;t push that far into the endurance realm of things (floor routines generally don&rsquo;t go longer than 90 seconds), it&rsquo;s not purely anaerobic and does a good job of working strength, power, and medium length strength-endurance.</span></p><p class="c65"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 301.50px; height: 452.89px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.png" style="width: 301.50px; height: 452.89px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">Beyond just being fit for the sake of being fit, one benefit I&rsquo;ve found is that being fit across many domains (upper and lower body, power/strength/endurance, balance) means that when you want to try a new physical activity, you&rsquo;re generally well prepared to jump right in. So even if you end up moving to a different activity (or simply supplementing your newfound gymnastics hobby), chances are good that the fitness you&rsquo;ve gained in the gym will translate well to any new sport or activity. Beyond the realm of other sports, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that whole body fitness is important for increasing your &ldquo;healthspan&rdquo; (a term coined by Peter Attia in his book &ldquo;Outlive&rdquo;) - how many years you have in a body that can do most of what you want it to do. Put differently: gymnastics doesn&#39;t just make you good at gymnastics; it makes you better at being a human with a body.</span></p><h2 class="c97 c79" id="h.w76p3xzfvqof"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Boredom&#39;s Antidote: The Infinite Skill Tree</span></h2><p class="c65"><span class="c3">You could replicate much of gymnastics&rsquo; physical benefits by going to the gym and lifting weights, doing plyometrics, and hitting the treadmill. The problem with that is that it&rsquo;s SUPER BORING. Gymnastics, on the other hand, is like solving a physical puzzle while accidentally getting ripped. Most of the time in gymnastics you&rsquo;re either trying to figure out how to get your body and brain to do what you know they need to or figuring out what you need to do in the first place. And if you get bored, frustrated, or stuck on a given skill? Lucky for you, there are thousands of other things you can work on! Even better, when you come back to the skill you paused on, the other things you&rsquo;ve learned and the strength and flexibility you&rsquo;ve gained in the meantime will likely have increased your chances of progressing on the original skill. I pole vaulted for 6 years before picking up gymnastics, and while the two sports have a lot in common, the lack of variety in pole vaulting meant that mental or physical stumbling blocks were a lot more frustrating and disheartening than they&rsquo;ve been in gymnastics. Same thing with distance running, soccer, and every other sport I&rsquo;ve tried. On a similar note, the infinite variety means that if you really don&rsquo;t like a given apparatus or skill, you can just not do it! There&rsquo;s plenty of other things to dive (roll) into, and no one is forcing you to do anything!</span></p><p class="c65"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 577.50px; height: 447.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image93.png" style="width: 577.50px; height: 447.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c33 c44 c14">There are hundreds of pages like this, filled with skills to try - and you can always make up your own if something isn&rsquo;t already in there!</span></p><h2 class="c97 c79" id="h.x8zwu1jzcfwo"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">I Think You Should Try Defying Gravity</span></h2><p class="c65"><span class="c3">There&rsquo;s a reason so many people dream about flying - it&rsquo;s fucking awesome. Gymnastics is the safest, cheapest way to satisfy this craving without investing in skydiving gear or joining NASA. The psychophysical experience of momentary weightlessness creates a neurological reward that&rsquo;s difficult to replicate through other means. That split second of flight during a flip activates proprioceptive and vestibular systems in ways our evolutionary history simply didn&rsquo;t prepare us for. At first, you&rsquo;ll probably be distracted by the fact that you have no idea what&rsquo;s going on and your brain is trying to process way too much novel sensory input, but once you start filtering all of that out, all that&rsquo;s left is the flight. The feeling of flipping through the air or swinging around a steel bar over and over just can&rsquo;t be beat, and every time I get back in the gym after some time off I&rsquo;m just so thankful I get to experience such a sublime feeling.</span></p><h2 class="c97 c79" id="h.y8rjzcq78hvq"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Controlled Terror as Cognitive Medicine</span></h2><p class="c65"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 465.50px; height: 337.87px;"><img alt="" src="images/image51.png" style="width: 465.50px; height: 337.87px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">Yes, fear is good, and there are three main reasons:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_i2on67a40c09-0 start" start="1"><li class="c65 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Mandated Mindfulness:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;When part of your brain (whether rationally or irrationally, you&rsquo;ll experience both in this sport) is worried you might be about to die, instinct takes over and shoves all other thoughts aside. I guarantee you won&rsquo;t be ruminating about that project that&rsquo;s overdue at work, or the fight you got in with your partner last night, or any of the other myriad stresses and worries that plague our everyday lives. So while some people meditate to clear their minds, I recommend something way more fun: controlled and repeated exposure to situations where part of your brain is screaming &ldquo;AHHHHHHHH!!!&rdquo;. I have found it to be extremely healthy and &ldquo;mentally refreshing&rdquo; to have a dedicated, regular block of time where I won&rsquo;t (and can&rsquo;t) think about all the other things going on in my life. </span></li><li class="c65 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Adjusting the Fear Baseline:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The principle of hedonic adaptation is that our brains eventually get used to even the most amazing feeling things, causing them to eventually become less enjoyable as your brain recalibrates to fit the new range of experiences into the standard spectrum. This has the downside of making things that used to feel quite good feel less good in comparison as the spectrum of feeling gets compressed and shifted. Down on the negative end of the spectrum, however, this can be a positive outcome! When you flip backwards and risk landing on your head (don&rsquo;t worry you don&rsquo;t do this on day one!) regularly, this gets pegged as the new &ldquo;oh my god I&rsquo;m so scared&rdquo; end of the spectrum, and having that stressful talk with your boss to ask for a promotion no longer feels quite so scary. As with everything in this review, your mileage may vary, but at least in my experience this has made mundane &ldquo;scary&rdquo; activities much more approachable.</span></li><li class="c65 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Humility and Empathy via Brain Betrayal:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;In most of our lives, it seems like we&rsquo;re in full control of our bodies: when you want to pick up your phone, your hand does exactly what you want and reaches out and grasps the phone. But it becomes glaringly obvious that things aren&rsquo;t quite that simple when you do any fear-adjacent activity like gymnastics. You might be fully physically capable of a skill, have done it multiple times in the past, know that if you do the correct technique it will be safe and easy, and know that if you do the wrong thing it&rsquo;ll get more dangerous. And yet when you go to do the skill, your brain (or at least my brain) regularly goes &ldquo;HOLD MY BEER!&rdquo; and grabs control of your body and does the instinctual &ldquo;oh my god I&rsquo;m upside down and falling and twisting&rdquo; thing, which unfortunately almost always makes things worse.<br><br>Imagine if everyday life was like this: you go to take a pot of pasta off the stove, you&rsquo;ve done it plenty of times, and you know that you just need to grab the handle where it won&rsquo;t be too hot. Then as you reach out, for some reason instead you just slap your hand against the bottom side of the pot and burn yourself. That&rsquo;s what happens all the time when you&rsquo;re learning new skills you&rsquo;re afraid of. Don&rsquo;t worry, you set up mats and spotting and harnesses and belts and whatnot to make the consequences non-disastrous. Experiencing things like this regularly makes me more aware and thankful that the rest of my life operates so smoothly! <br><br>Another side effect of this awareness (at least for me) is an increased level of empathy for others who are seemingly acting against their own interests. In my everyday life, I&rsquo;m pretty good at doing things that are good for me, but experiencing first hand obviously self-defeating behavior in the gym gives me a better idea of what it might be like for those who do similar things in more conventional settings.</span></li></ol><h2 class="c97 c79" id="h.f4rbfbttkfim"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Accidental Abs: Aesthetic Side Effects May Occur</span></h2><p class="c65"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention the impact of this very physical activity on what your body looks like.

I hope this seven-part review can help share what the program actually is and that this review is more open minded than the critics, but is something that would never get past an Alpha public relations gatekeeper:</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_ys3q76v362uu-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Starting Point: My Assumptions:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;how my views on elite private schools, tutoring and acceleration shaped the experiment (and this essay). </span><span class="c8 c9">WHAT</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;is the existing education environment.<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">A Short History of Alpha:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;from billionaire&#8209;funded microschool to charter aspirations. </span><span class="c8 c9">HOW</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;Alpha came to be.<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">How Alpha Works Part 1: Under the Hood:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;What does &ldquo;2&#8209;hour learning&rdquo; actually look like &ndash; what is the product and the science behind the product? </span><span class="c8 c9">HOW</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;is Alpha getting kids to learn faster (Spoiler: &ldquo;Two hour learning AI learning&rdquo; closer to three hours, with a 5:1 teacher:student ratio and zero &ldquo;generative AI&rdquo;).<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">How Alpha Works Part 2: Incentives &amp; Motivation:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;The secret sauce that doesn&rsquo;t get mentioned in the PR copy, but I have discovered is at least as important as the fancy technology.

We were not happy with the status quo. While much has been written about how private schools generally handled COVID better than their public counterparts, our school was an exception. While other private schools in the area had moved back to full time in-person learning on campus, ours continued to stream YouTube yoga for P.E. To their credit, other teachers tried harder, but none had experience trying to teach five-year olds over Zoom, and frankly the Youtube videos were sometimes the most engaging content the kids experienced in a given day.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">We paid $35,000/year so instructors could curate videos for our kids &ndash; and that didn&rsquo;t even include babysitting (I set up my &ldquo;office&rdquo; in the closet of her room so I could help when she needed it. You could imagine how productive I was that year).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">A friend who had had kids graduate from the school recommended I speak with the head of the board. He in turn suggested we get a group of parents together to write a proposal and get it in front of the head of the school. That was exactly what we did. We summarized the academic data breakdowns on the risk of COVID to children including spreading rates at schools with different policies. We provided examples of what other schools around the world were doing both to mitigate risk of spread, but also to ensure more engaged learning from the kids &ndash; options for better ventilation, outdoor pods options &ndash; anything but more Zoom yoga for our five&#8209;year&#8209;olds. She did not respond the way the head of the board led us to expect she would. The response wasn&rsquo;t gratitude or &nbsp;appreciation &ndash; or even interest; it was an invitation to grovel so our kindergartener could remain enrolled &ndash; &ldquo;</span><span class="c8 c9 c54">This meeting is not about your proposal or changing anything. This meeting is to decide if you are still a good fit for our school</span><span class="c13 c9">&rdquo;. That was the moment the shine of the school&rsquo;s claim to be a &ldquo;inspiration for gifted children&rdquo; had completely vanished. We were no longer enrolled either emotionally or analytically. We were enrolled because we didn&rsquo;t see any better alternatives.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">Voice clearly wasn&rsquo;t an option; </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169856392&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VivHoQP4soWu3blaAy785">Hirschman&rsquo;s trilemma</a></span><span class="c9 c54">&nbsp;left us with </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">&ldquo;loyalty or exit.&rdquo;</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;We chose loyalty, mostly because in the short term there was no way to switch to the few schools that were allowing in-person learning during COVID, and in the longer term, we just hoped the school would &ldquo;fix itself&rdquo; once things got back to normal, and switching would mean either moving or accepting much longer commutes. Hopefully COVID would be over soon.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">What selective private schools do well</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">In order to get into this school our kids needed to score in the top 3% on an </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169857116&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tloDcyGacJ4O_-quixaB3">IQ-test</a></span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;they took when they were four-years old. As parents we needed to complete a college-style application with a dozen short essays (&ldquo;How will your family contribute to the DEI goals of our school?&rdquo;). The most promising of the high-IQ preschoolers whose parents did not screw-up the essay questions were given an opportunity to experience an in-person day of group assessments. Roughly half of those kids were offered admittance.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">Now, after four years with three kids at this ultra-selective school, I can name exactly </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">four genuine upgrades</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;over our neighborhood public school:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_7rq47xihekse-0 start"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Tiny classes</span><span class="c13 c9">&#8239;&ndash; teacher&#8209;to&#8209;student ratio hovered around&#8239;10&#8239;:&#8239;1 versus 25:1 or worse at the public school<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Exceptional peers</span><span class="c13 c9">&#8239;&ndash; classroom disruption was rare, they were surrounded by incredibly bright and motivated classmates &ndash; kids enthralled by learning rather than make-up and crop tops (yes, even in elementary schools)<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Deep pockets</span><span class="c13 c9">&#8239;&ndash; music rooms, tech labs, theatre programs &ndash; even ski trips<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">No bottom&#8209;quartile teachers</span><span class="c13 c9">&#8239;&ndash; there were weak teachers, but nothing like the worst duds you hear about, or that I had experienced as a child. No one was &ldquo;phoning it in&rdquo;.<br></span></li></ul><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">But&hellip; for many other characteristics I did not see any difference from the free, local, public schools:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_nkvw1ybj0s9f-0 start"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Median teacher skill </span><span class="c13 c9">&asymp; public median. Our friends in the public schools had lots of great teachers.<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Best teacher skill </span><span class="c13 c9">&asymp; public best. Some of the best teachers at our school left to teach in the public schools<br></span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c54">Same state curriculum, same worksheets, </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">same pace.</span><span class="c13 c9"><br></span></li></ul><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">The school philosophy was &ldquo;</span><span class="c8 c9 c54">no acceleration&mdash;just go deep.</span><span class="c9 c54">&rdquo; We knew this was the philosophy going in. The pitch was that instead of accelerating through the state curriculum the teachers would take their time with the kids and allow them to fully explore and master the content of each grade. When we asked for examples of what that meant in practice we were told things like: &ldquo;Instead of reading more advanced vocabulary, the students will learn to read out loud and use emotion and character impressions. They will learn how to vary the timing of their reading like where and when to pause to create emotion in the listener&rdquo;. That sounded reasonable! It sounded like more learning, but just </span><span class="c9 c14 c54">different</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;learning than what the state had mandated.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">In practice that was not what happened.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">In practice &ldquo;deep&rdquo; just meant &ldquo;un&#8209;measured.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">Smart kids + small classes &ne; accountability.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">The kids had time to do music, lego building, theatre and Friday ski trips because they were all really bright. They didn&rsquo;t need 6+ hours a day to learn the limited math required by the state, and since the school did not feel the need to advance faster than the state, there was no pressure to push learning at all &ndash; on anything really.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">There was no overall school curriculum. Every teacher did their own thing. While one first grade class had weekly spelling bees, the teacher in the other classroom did not believe in learning spelling at all. But it didn&rsquo;t matter. The metrics they measured the kids on in both classes advanced &ldquo;enough&rdquo; that no one was concerned.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">Most time wasn&rsquo;t spent on math or language anyway. Beyond the brochure activities like skiing and theater and the four hours of foreign language per week they split between Spanish and Mandarin (which was really a great opportunity for the kids who already spoke Spanish and Mandarin to have their ego&rsquo;s flattered. I did not see any </span><span class="c9 c14 c54">learning</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;in either language class. I don&rsquo;t see how you can teach a language a couple of hours a week to a group of 18 kids with skill levels from zero to fluency and expect to have any impact), a lot of time was spent on DEI.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">DEI was pitched as helping kids handle the emotions that often come from being sensitive gifted children (they called it &ldquo;Synapse&rdquo;). In practice my oldest daughter got four years of learning about the basic ideas of Martin Luther King Junior and Rosa Parks, a rough understanding that some people are non-binary, and a great deal of anxiety every time I left the water running while I was brushing my teeth.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">The talent drain</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">In Spring &#8239;2024 the &ldquo;intermediate-school&rdquo; head resigned, as did the 40+ year veteran science teacher we had been looking forward to our daughter having, the beloved tech teacher who had built a her own proprietary &ldquo;learn to type&rdquo; software, plus half the lower&#8209;school faculty. Our oldest was going to be entering fourth grade; her incoming roster read like a rebuilding year for a professional sports team. It was possible we could get her into a middle school that would feed into a top tier high school, but those did not start until 5th grade. Our best option looked like &ldquo;suck it up and accept whatever we had for at least a year&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">One option was to do something radical. We considered taking a GAP year and traveling the world with an organization called &ldquo;</span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://boundless.life/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169863543&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WixidTg3UGuL3f1X4iNlp">Boundless</a></span><span class="c9 c54">&rdquo; but decided the timing wasn&rsquo;t right. Earlier in the year we had started exploring moving to the charter city of </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.prospera.co/en&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169863752&amp;usg=AOvVaw278037mv866LlgmMmMYWi1">Prospera</a></span><span class="c13 c9">. There is a Montessori school there that seemed like it might be alright. And we could surround the kids with an interesting group of people (and live on the beach!). But by the spring we had ruled it out. There did not seem to be many families as part of the community and we were not comfortable with the risk profile based on what was happening with the conflict between Honduras and their charter cities.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Then I stumbled across Alpha: Two&#8209;hour mornings, life&#8209;skills afternoons, claims of 2x learning. Marketing copy is cheap; still, the promise was different enough to warrant due diligence. The initial plan was to fly some of the kids to Austin for an Alpha summer camp for a week in June &ndash; just to try it out. But once we started exploring more my wife asked me: &ldquo;Could we actually move to Austin and try it for a year? Based on what is happening at the kids&#39; school, this might be the year to try it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">So over eight weeks we flew to Austin </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">five times</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;&ndash; conversations with admissions and school heads, real estate searches, kids doing shadow&#8209;days. Every parent we spoke to was very impressed with the school. Their kids really were advancing at 2x+ speed &ndash; and no one believed it was just a &ldquo;selection effect&rdquo;. And every guide I spoke to was extremely impressive themselves. They reminded me of the staff you run into when visiting Disney World. They all seemed &ldquo;full faced&rdquo; and fully-engaged. When I asked the head of admissions how they found such good staff he told me their compensation was fully transparent. &ldquo;Associate Guides&rdquo; were paid $60,000/year (vs the $40,000 average for Austin teachers), &ldquo;Full Guides&rdquo; made $100,000 and the five &ldquo;Head Guides&rdquo; in the school each made $150,000. They were able to both poach the best teachers from other schools, but also bring exceptional people into teaching that would not have considered it otherwise. It also let them have very high expectations for teachers once they were hired.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">We pulled the trigger in July.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">New house. Admissions letter signed. Moving truck (plus car-mover) scheduled for October.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Worst case, it would be a one&#8209;year sabbatical from stagnation.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">The hypothesis I carried south</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">Elite private schools attendance buys you smaller classes, brighter kids, and fancier field trips &ndash; </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">not academic acceleration</span><span class="c9 c54">. If Alpha was real, we&rsquo;d see that differential, measurable impact by Christmas &ndash; that was when we would need to decide if we would cut bait and re-apply to schools back home (and sign the kids up for more IQ-tests. The school would not accept old ones).

Morning &ldquo;core blocks&rdquo; were still </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">teacher&#8209;driven</span><span class="c9 c54">&nbsp;(20&#8209;minute bursts, 5&#8209;minute breaks, rinse, repeat), but focused on students engaged in exercises with rapid feedback (not lectures). Afternoon workshops covered &ldquo;life skills&rdquo; like how to give and receive feedback or public speaking. I have not seen academic data from this time period, but when I spoke to Chris Locke, head of Alpha&rsquo;s high school (which launched around 2020), he told me the kids coming into his 9th grade program were &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; academically &ndash; it was their life skills, confidence, and ability to engage with adults and their peers were exceptional. At this stage </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">no AI, no dashboard, no 2x learning, no portal&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;just better ratios and focused pacing</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;and the result was well balanced kids who were enjoying their education experience (even if they were unexceptional academically).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">2020&#8239;&ndash;&#8239;2022 | Platform Era Begins</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Somewhere along the way Liemandt hired a small engineering team to stitch together edtech learning tools. Many schools use tools like iXL, Beast Academy and Amira. Those tools fit in well with the 2-hour structured approach Alpha was using. The &ldquo;platform&rdquo; Liemandt&rsquo;s team built was meant as a tool to free up guide time so that students could be more self-directed. The dev team stitched together the preferred off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf apps behind a single login, and built out tracking and dashboards so guides (and students) could easily see how they were progressing. This also gave the curriculum team (there was a curriculum team now) data to understand where students were spending their time, what tools were working, and which weren&rsquo;t as effective.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">The </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">Alpha Portal</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;was born. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Not only did it increase efficiency, it provided data to iterate with.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Chris&#8239;Locke saw the curve change incrementally: each new cohort of ninth&#8209;graders under the new tech-enabled learning platform came in a little stronger academically. The &ldquo;life skills&rdquo; were now being matched by the &ldquo;academic skills&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">2022 | Expansion and Iteration</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">By having access to Alpha kids post-graduation in the high school, Locke could send feedback back to the elementary school.The kids coming out of the new program were now killing it academically on Math, Language, and Science, but they were still weak on things like History and Geography. He fed that type of information back to the curriculum designers, who iterated and improved the program. Soon, in addition to the core platform that directed students to third-party tools, the tech team was building proprietary &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; tools themselves. The flagship of the in-house tools was &ldquo;AlphaReads&rdquo;. AlphaReads requires students to read progressively more complicated passages, followed by answering reading comprehension questions. In addition to helping the kids improve reading skills, Alpha uses it to push types of content. Instead of classes in history, geography, economics and political science, some of the reading passages will cover that material (in addition to learning how to read and understand Shakespeare and Proust).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">The success of the 2-hour learning platform was giving the Alpha founders confidence. Liemandt in particular wanted to see if the program had legs beyond the elite group of students being educated in Austin. Alpha&rsquo;s first external test in August 2022 in </span><span class="c8 c9 c54">Brownsville,&#8239;TX</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;&ndash; a small community on the Mexico border with less than half the per capita income of Austin. SpaceX had recently launched Starbase in Brownsville in 2014 and the employees there were not happy with the existing school options. Someone at SpaceX approached Alpha dn asked if they could launch a new campus for their employees. It is unclear if any money changed hands, but when Alpha launched their Brownsville campus (available to SpaceX employees and any other locals who are interested) tuition was only $10,000 (vs $40,000 at the main Austin campus); incoming students trailed national academic standards by over a year. But after nine months on the Alpha program the first cohort of students had caught up and surpassed the national average, and they kept accelerating, achieving an average learning velocity of ~2&times; the national average (see section four for what that means). Brownsville was Alpha&rsquo;s attempt to show that their model wasn&rsquo;t just rich&#8209;kid selection effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">Spring&#8239;2024 | Field Pilots &amp; Ukraine Trip</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Alpha tuition is high for the Austin area ($40,000 vs average private school ~$10,000-$15,000), but unlike most private schools tuition is all-inclusive. There are no extra fees for computers or field trips. There are no silent auctions or appeals for donations. This &ldquo;no extra fees&rdquo; allows the school to do some pretty ridiculous things.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">In the first half of 2024 Alpha sent a group of students to Poland to help launch a 2-hour learning pilot among Ukrainian refugees. Students did not pay to go on the trip. But students also did not have a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to go on the trip. They had to earn it. In addition to being on top of academic and non-academic expectations, students who wanted to participate had to learn basic Ukrainian so they could interact with the students in Poland they were meant to be helping. By not linking the opportunity to payment, the school could instead link it to behavior and achievement.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">This year a group of kids who learned to sail during the school year are going on a sailing trip through the Caribbean &ndash; for no additional fees to the parents.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">I also heard that around this time Alpha began testing the 2-hour learning platform at a facility for juvenile delinquents in Florida. I heard that from one individual who was not directly involved and I have not found any written documentation on it, so unclear if it worked, it was a one off, or if it even happened. But it fits into the pattern of Alpha at this stage: &ldquo;We know this program works for a specific type of kid. Let&rsquo;s find out how broadly it is applicable. Can it work for everyone? Is it the solution for learning and education for the world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">Fall&#8239;2024 | &ldquo;Pick&#8209;Your&#8209;Afternoon&rdquo; Specialist Schools</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">MacKenzie told me that there was consensus among the current parents of Alpha that the 2-hour learning program was exceptional and was making a huge difference with their kids. Their kids were all learning at breathtaking speed in a very condensed period of time. But there was NOT consensus about what the kids should be doing in the other 22-hours of the day. Some parents wanted to utilize the platform&rsquo;s capabilities to go even faster. Some wanted their kids to just chill out and enjoy the rest of their day &ndash; let kids be kids. Others wanted their kids to use the freed up time to do sports, or study music.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">It was clear to her that &ldquo;learn more faster in a short period of time&rdquo; was a universal desire. But beyond that it was unclear what the &ldquo;right&rdquo; solution for the rest of her program was. You can make the morning ultra-personalized, but if the goal of the afternoon is socialization that you are missing in the morning, you need to have some sort of alignment on how to spend that afternoon.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">That challenge led to Alpha&rsquo;s 2024 expansion into specialty schools.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Three micro&#8209;campuses opened August&#8239;2024:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_nom4w28sbj2y-0 start"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c8 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gt.school/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169876798&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ECkZJ-HHmvYgak0uwVyK8">GT&#8239;School</a></span><span class="c8 c9 c54">&nbsp;(Georgetown, TX)</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;&mdash; Alpha&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gifted and Talented&rdquo; School.

Early homeschool data showed that kids were using it for ~2 hours/day as planned, but only seeing a 1x learning growth &mdash; still a fine result for only doing 2-hours of academics per day, but a long way from what Alpha was delivering on their own campuses, so the program has stayed in beta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c57 c51 c8 c9 c54">Jan&#8239;2025 | Charter &amp; Licence Play</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">Alpha now had a parent company, &ldquo;</span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2hourlearning.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169878752&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rQT6-dRPPxanY56Vu_Gl1">2-hour Learning</a></span><span class="c13 c9">&rdquo;, which sat above all of the schools, the home school product, and the platform itself (that they now offer to license out to third parties). The parent company filed under &ldquo;Unbound Academy&rdquo; to launch charter schools in Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania school was rejected, but the Arizona school will launch in fall 2025. There are more applications pending in at least Utah, Arkansa, North Carolina, South Carolina (and likely more).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c54">While the PR spin around these schools is &ldquo;AI-driven, no teachers&rdquo; in practice they use 20:1 </span><span class="c9 c54 c92">teacher</span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;guide:student ratios (vs the 5:1 ratio at the Alpha private schools)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Generally states subsidize charter schools in the neighborhood of $10,000 per student &ndash; which is a lot lower than what Alpha charges. They should be able to make those economics work by using fewer, less expensive teachers, not having an expensive campus (or no campus at all for the online schools), skimming on the extras (no trips to Poland), avoiding teaching the youngest kids (Arizona is 4th-8th grade), and being willing to accept smaller or even negligible margin on their learning platform.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">The goal of these schools does not seem to be making money or profit &ndash; at least not right away. The goal seems to be rapidly expanding the program to have more influence, and to see if they can make it work with &ldquo;non-selected kids at a low price point&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c9 c54">Fall 2025 and Beyond | The Future</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c54">The Alpha website claims the following </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://alpha.school/locations/%23&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169880608&amp;usg=AOvVaw3E2wqLCKi4U69SEYG00mpU">locations</a></span><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;are launching in Fall 2025:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_r4k268yaw1uw-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Houston, TX</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Fort Worth, TX</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Santa Barbara, CA</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Phoenix, AR</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Orlando, FL</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Tampa, FL</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">Palm Beach, FL</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c9">New York City, NY</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">I also know that there is a physical location selected for Fort Lauderdale. While it is possible they launch eight (or nine) new campuses in the fall (they did pull off four last year), I expect that is more about &ldquo;putting it out there&rdquo; and then launching the campuses that get enough commitment. It is hard to launch a new school. Parents are risk averse, and many who are willing to take risks may not do it if they don&rsquo;t think the school is even likely to happen. Better to say you are going to launch in Fort Worth, and then see what demand looks like. You can pull the trigger or pull the shoot depending on which markets are getting natural traction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">In the Fall of 2024 in addition to the four campuses they did launch, they said they were going to go live with a campus in Denver, ten micro schools and the (non-beta) home school program &ndash; none of which happened. My guess is that four of the eight schools they announced will have guides working and kids attending in September 2025.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c9">Now: What do these schools actually do?

The incentive system &ndash; a very important, undiscussed part of the secret sauce &ndash; will get its own section in Part Four.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">The Two-Hour Platform</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Every Alpha &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; &ndash; the core school, the home school, the Gifted School, the sports school &ndash; uses the same 2-hour learning platform.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">We drop our kids off around 8:30am. After a morning kick-off (some sort of group activity) they put on (optional) headphones, find a place to work (the school is a bit like a start-up office), and log in to their personal 2-hour learning platform. The platform informs each student what their specific required lessons are for the day (usually between 8-12 lessons). Those &ldquo;required&rdquo; lessons are called &ldquo;minimums&rdquo; and the kids talk about it that way:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_cfxhoiou8tdl-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">&ldquo;Did you hit your minimums?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">&ldquo;I missed my minimums by one lesson today but it wasn&rsquo;t my fault&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">&ldquo;We got to skip our minimums today to do MAP testing&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">&ldquo;Guess what dad!

After every question the student is given feedback &ndash; either &ldquo;Great Job!&rdquo; (with the option to click and learn more) or &ldquo;Incorrect&rdquo; followed by explanations on why the question was wrong and a mini-remedial lesson to fill in the knowledge gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">If a pattern of stumbles appears the system will automatically task the student to book a &ldquo;coaching call&rdquo; with a remote teacher (most of these teachers seem to be based in Brazil). Kids can also choose to self-book calls with the &ldquo;coaches&rdquo; at any time (my daughter told me today that she was having trouble with a math problem set and she booked a coaching call. I asked her how long it took between when she booked it and when she had the call and she said it depends on how busy the coaches are. Today she booked it at 11:10 and had the call at 11:15, but she said once it took her two days to get the meeting. I sked her how often she has a call and she said less than once a day, but more than once a week). The kids also automatically do a coaching call before they can schedule a &ldquo;mastery test&rdquo; which covers all the grade level material in a subject (like a final exam). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">At the end of the day the students get a report on their achievements that day, as well as overall feedback (this is potentially where the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; comes in. The computers track both clicks and eye tracking. It can tell both what the student clicked, but also if they were paying attention or distracted, or how much effort they put into reading the feedback when they got questions wrong).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">All of this is shared with the parents on our own dashboard.

Normally in school you do your work, submit it, have it graded, and get it back some time in the future &ndash; if you are lucky after you finish a full problem set, if unlucky a week or two later. With Alpha 100% of the time you get feedback immediately after you answer each question. If you are wrong you both get to find out right away and find out what you did wrong so you won&rsquo;t repeat the mistake on the next question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">In addition to the daily report, parents also have access to a weekly summary and an overall progress report. The latter is the most interesting. It tells you how many lessons your kid has completed at each grade level difficulty, how many more lessons they need to master to move on to the next grade, and how long that is likely to take at the rate they are progressing. Here is my 2nd grader&rsquo;s recent report:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 213.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image111.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 213.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">She has &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; 81/113 lessons for 3rd grade language, 141/157 3rd grade math, and 62/80 3rd grade science. If she stays on track doing 25-minutes in each subject per day for five days per week, she will complete 3rd grade in Language in three weeks, math in one week and science in four weeks. And if she decides to push harder and do an additional 35 minutes in a subject every day she will be finished 3rd grade within the week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">When a student finishes all the lessons they need for a grade level subject they take a grade-level mastery test that covers all the material they were supposed to learn. If they get a high enough score on that test they move on to the next grade level (all of the questions they missed will still come back for later review though so they don&rsquo;t move on with gaps). If they do not pass that test then they keep working on more lessons on the grade they are currently on with a focus on closing the gaps they need to pass next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">During these morning sessions every 20-30 minutes the kids get what is called a &ldquo;Q-break&rdquo; where they leave their computers for 5-10 minutes and go run around outside. The culture is one of &ldquo;focus hard for short bursts, then relax, then go back and focus again&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Most schools are set up in traditional ways, and then adjust the best they can within that structure to serve the needs of their unique students the best they can. What is impressive about the Alpha program is that is seems to be built from the ground-up around three of the most powerful learning principles:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_cm0uuytvn8fq-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">1:1 learning:</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not really 1:1, but in practice every kids is working on stuff at the edge of their ability, rather than the median of a group</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Spaced Repetition: </span><span class="c25 c9">The system brings back topics on a regular basis &ldquo;just before&rdquo; the student forgets, so it is more likely to encode in long term memory</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Mastery:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;In most education settings school students learn some percentage of the material and then move on. This can work for a while, but eventually students who missed something will struggle because they don&rsquo;t have the tools to learn the next thing on the ladder. This is particularly noticeable in mathematics, but it can be a problem anywhere. With &ldquo;mastery learning&rdquo; the kids are not allowed to move on without mastering the subject. If there is something they miss, the system will bring it back again and again until they have mastered it. </span><span class="c9 c54">Liemandt</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;in particular thinks this is a very big deal, and believes it is a significant driver of Alpha&rsquo;s success (and the reason many kids are failing in traditional schools)</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The morning &ldquo;2-hour learning&rdquo; session wraps up around noon. For those tracking at home that is &ldquo;drop off at 830am, finish 2-hour learning 3.5 hours later&rdquo;. They really are spending roughly 2 hours learning, it just takes half the day to get that 2-hours of focus in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Then the afternoon begins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c9">Alpha Afternoons</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Afternoons are where the Alpha family of schools diverge. The Sports Academy is doing very different things in the afternoon than the GT school.

The 5th graders learned about the economics of property management - from property sourcing, mortgages, interior design, taxes, marketing, photo shoots, etc. And then they actually bought and managed a small property as a class (yes, the 5th grade class manages an actual property with a P&amp;L)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Those are a select list of the coolest ones (in my opinion). Some friends who go to the main campus complained to us that the workshops in general are &ldquo;not academic enough&rdquo;. They say most are either &ldquo;sports&rdquo; (they mentioned sailing, golf, and running), or &ldquo;entrepreneurship&rdquo;. When they pushed the administration on potentially doing more academic-minded workshops (writing, history seminars, economics, psychology, chemistry) they were told, &ldquo;you sound like GT parents.

People REALLY don&rsquo;t like paying kids to read books.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">So what do these parents think we should do instead? Mostly they believe that kids should just be &ldquo;intrinsically motivated&rdquo; and school should be about inspiring that internal motivation. Their concern is that if we provide external motivation for learning it will crowd out internal motivation. They worry that when the external motivation goes away (no one is going to pay a 30-year-old to read books), there is no internal motivation to keep learning happening. In this model &ldquo;education&rdquo; is not about educating per se, or even about teaching habits, it is about inspiring character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">The other option is that rather than use the carrot, you could use the stick. Fryer shares another poll from 2008 where 26% of parents think grade-school teachers should be allowed to </span><span class="c8 c9">spank kids </span><span class="c25 c9">(35% in the Southern US states!).

If bribing kids gets them to learn more while they are kids that seems good. If it causes them long term motivation issues, that seems bad. My instinct is to try and quantify both effects and then understand what the trade-off is to make a decision on what we should do (and my ingoing hypothesis is that it likely depends on the kid, so you need a big enough &ldquo;n&rdquo; to distinguish different types of kids).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Fryer is the leading researcher in this field, at least in the short term impact of these programs.

When he paid kids $2 for each book they read, they read a lot more books (+40%). When he paid kids to show up to class and not be late, tardiness dropped 22% versus the control group. But when he tried targeting the end goal and paying students more for higher test scores he saw no effect. Tell a kid to read a book or show up on time and they know what they need to do to get the money. Tell them to get higher scores on tests and, while they have a rough idea how to do that (pay more attention in class, study longer and more efficiently), the actual things they need to do are not entirely clear and the inputs they put in (studying) are not directly tied to the outputs (test scores) &ndash; and the incentives have no impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">As far as I know Fryer has not done any super-long-term studies of the impact of his experiments, but he did look at the mid-term effects. After the &ldquo;read books for $$s&rdquo; study ended he followed the test and control group for what happened to their reading habits when they were not getting paid. He found, in contradiction to concerns about loss of internal motivation, that the test group continued to read more than the control group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">When we pay kids to take on new habits, the habits tend to stick after the incentives go away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Is this that different from incentivizing your kids to eat their vegetables and then rewarding them with dessert? The hope is that they will build the habit of eating vegetables and will eat them without external rewards when they are older and understand the value of the habit you have built for them as children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">None of this should not be too surprising for people who have read Anders Ericsson&rsquo;s work on building expertise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Ericsson is most famous for being the source of Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;10,000 hour of practice to become an expert&rdquo; meme. Ericsson was not impressed by Gladwell&rsquo;s simplification of his findings and he wrote an </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise/dp/1531864880&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169909478&amp;usg=AOvVaw39Ghj0g5l2ZDqhRVKWszwh">excellent book</a></span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;detailing what his findings really meant. That book describes the study Gladwell used to get to 10,000 hours.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">At the elite music school in Berlin, the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik, Ericsson sorted students into three groups by ability: future soloists, future orchestra professionals, and future teachers. He found that the three groups did not differ systematically in most characteristics. As groups they had the same IQs, the same age of starting music, and the same quality and quantity of instruction. The only measurable difference he found between the groups was the number of lifetime hours they had committed to &ldquo;deliberate practice&rdquo;. From age&#8239;eight onward the future soloists logged almost three times more practice hours per week than the future teachers. On average the soloists had clocked in 10,000 hours of practice by the time they started at their elite music college.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">That was where Gladwell got his 10,000 hour rule.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">(One of Ericsson&rsquo;s problems with Gladwell&rsquo;s simplification is that he saw nothing special about 10,000 hours. There was a significant range among the elite students &ndash; 10,000 was just the average; Also the elite students were still just &lsquo;students&rsquo; and while they were on track to become world class, none of them were world class yet. Ericsson estimates that would take another ten years of practice putting most of their total practice time to achieve world class performance well over 20,000 hours)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Ericsson&rsquo;s next question was WHY did some students practice more than others? All of these kids wanted to be great musicians and have careers as musicians and all had dedicated large parts of their life to the craft, so why did some choose to practice more than others? His initial hypothesis is that some people just enjoyed practicing more than others. He dismissed the idea that some kids were just more talented than others, and replaced it with some kids, whether for genetic or environmental reasons, were just more &ldquo;into practice&rdquo; than others. But when he questioned the students he found that was not true at all.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">The future elite soloists of the music world all </span><span class="c9 c14">hated</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;practicing.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">And so did everyone else.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">All of the musicians at the school did not like the process of practicing. They enjoyed playing. They enjoyed being good musicians. They just hated the process of practicing to get good.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">So why did they do it?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Because they wanted to be great musicians and they knew that they needed to practice to become great musicians.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">According to Ericsson, the key to being great is </span><span class="c8 c9">deliberate practice</span><span class="c9">. The key to deliberate practice is </span><span class="c8 c9">motivation</span><span class="c25 c9">.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Ericsson dug further to figure out where the motivation came from and he found it grew over three stages:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_nssfwmsrigwf-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Parental and authority approval: </span><span class="c9">Initially kids practice because they are given praise and attention from their parents when they do so, and are reprimanded when they don&rsquo;t. He gives examples of mom saying &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t practice an hour per day on piano I am going to stop paying for your music instructor&rdquo;.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Peer approval: </span><span class="c25 c9">At some point the young musicians begin to care less about what their parents think, and more about their relative status among their peers. Part of this is that they can perform music for their classmates, which is very impressive, but a bigger motivation is that their skills are recognized by other young musicians &ndash; their true peers.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Self Actualization:</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;Eventually the best musicians stop caring about their peers and start internalling the desire to be great. They see themselves as musicians, and they do the hard, uncomfortable work of practicing because &ldquo;that is what a great musician does&rdquo;. <br></span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Ericsson found every musician followed the same path (and he repeated it with other adult experts and came to the same conclusion).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">When we look at adult &ldquo;experts&rdquo; or even adults who are still learning by reading books, we see people who have internal motivation and self actualization. Why do you read books as an adult? I expect most people who read books do it because they </span><span class="c9 c14">like</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;reading books &ndash; and the reason they enjoy reading books is that they have read enough books in their lifetime that they are pretty good at reading books. For most people who read books, reading books is not &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; (if it is I expect most people put down that book and choose a less challenging one). And yes, many people read books to &ldquo;learn things,&rdquo; but almost everyone combines &ldquo;learning things&rdquo; with enjoyment. They enjoy the feeling of learning and they often retain parts of what they read, but it is a rare reader who takes notes while they are reading to review afterwards, or picks up a textbook after they have graduated from school. Many people want to learn, as long as the learning is enjoyable and not too much work. If retaining more of the learning takes extra effort, most people, most of the time, will not put in that effort. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">If you are the type of person who reads challenging books at the edge of your ability and takes detailed notes to review afterwards in a space repetition tool, I expect you do it because you feel you are &ldquo;the type of person who reads challenging books&rdquo; &ndash; you have achieved self-actualization in book reading and learning. You are not the majority. You aren&rsquo;t even the majority of the minority of people who read a lot of books.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Self actualization is where we want all our kids to reach (or at least &ldquo;become a strong enough reader that they enjoy reading books and will do it for pleasure&rdquo;). The question is how to get there. Ericsson has mapped out that path:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_tufqg1jnfd2q-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Start with adult-generated incentives</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Surround the children with peers who will raise their status for being &ldquo;learners&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Hope at some point they self-actualize</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Clearly not every kid will get to stage three (and no one will get to stage three in every endeavor), but Ericsson&rsquo;s point is that </span><span class="c8 c9">EVERY ONE who gets to stage three starts at stage one.</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;And we know how to motivate kids in stage one &ndash; or at least Roland Fryer does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Combining Ericsson and Fryer we get the success equation:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Incentives &rarr; Motivation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Motivation &rarr; Time spent on deliberate practice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Time spent on deliberate practice &rarr; Mastery</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Unfortunately we have an education system that doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;follow the data&rdquo; on how to best educate, and the general population hates the idea of incentives, so no one is pushing the education system to change in that dimension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Alpha </span><span class="c8 c9">HAS</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;followed the data. They have built deliberate and extensive incentive systems. But Alpha also knows what the general population thinks of incentives, so they don&rsquo;t talk about it. There are lots of parents that are against throwing kids learning in front of screens and lots of educators against &ldquo;too rapidly accelerating learning&rdquo;, but there are even more parents and educators against </span><span class="c9 c14">bribing</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;kids. When you see the complaints about Alpha on Reddit they criticize the AI and the screen time and the lack of teachers and the tuition and the &ldquo;funded by billionaires&rdquo; but no one complains about the incentive/bribery system. Because unless you go to Alpha you don&rsquo;t even know about the incentive system.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Alpha believes in the incentive system, and it is a very important part of their program, but they don&rsquo;t brag about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">Alpha&rsquo;s Incentive Programs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Alpha schools have their own in-house currency. Alpha has &ldquo;Alpha bucks&rdquo;; GT School has &ldquo;GT bucks&rdquo;. My understanding is that they work a little differently on each campus, but the overall philosophy is the same. This review will focus on the details of the GT system since it is what I know best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">If the students complete their 2-hour learning &ldquo;minimums&rdquo; each day they earn about 10 GT Bucks. They get additional bonuses for every lesson they complete beyond their minimums. They also get a bonus if they finish their minimums within the scheduled time (vs going home and doing them later), additional bonuses if the entire class completes their minimums during the allotted time, and weekly bonuses for hitting longer term targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">They only get credit if they both complete their lessons AND get 80% or higher on the problem sets within the lesson. If they get 79% they still move on (with the questions they missed coming back later for review), but they don&rsquo;t get the GT bucks associated with the lesson (this stops gaming where the kids rush through the lessons just to get &ldquo;bucks&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">A GT buck is worth 10-cents. So if they are really pushing a kid could be earning roughly $2 per day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Fryer paid kids to read books, GT pays kids to do lessons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Once a kid has earned a collection of GT bucks they can spend those bucks at the GT-store. The Alpha store has a wide selection of offerings. The GT store, because it is a much smaller school, is more like a catalog. The kids can select what they want and the school will order it so it is ready when they earn enough &ldquo;bucks&rdquo;. Every kid has their own personalized incentive &ndash; do the school work and they will get their personalized prize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Different kids respond to this differently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">My youngest spends his GT-bucks as he earns them &ndash; coming home most weeks with a bouncy ball or a protein bar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">My middle daughter has ambitions to save for things (she really wants a lego chess set), but often gives in and buys something before she saves enough (she has built an impressive collection of stuffies).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">My older daughter likes to save. She really wanted a Taylor Swift sweater and saved her points for months to buy it, but then, when she had enough bucks, she decided she didn&rsquo;t want to spend them &ndash; so no sweater but a record number of points in her balance statement (then my middle daughter used </span><span class="c9 c14">her</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;points to buy the sweater&hellip; You can imagine how that went&hellip;).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">My kids are gifted. They love learning. They compete in academic bees and chess tournaments and musical productions for fun. But the GT incentive system has turbo-charged their academic learning well beyond that inborn desire to learn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">We decided to join the GT school in July, but, for logistical reasons, we could not start until October. For the 3.5 months I signed the kids up to iXL &ndash; the tool that Alpha students use for 80% of their academic work &ndash; including almost all of their Language, Math and Science lessons. I wanted to get the kids used to using it over the summer before they started school. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c25"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">It did not go well. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">We tried getting the kids to work on it for about an hour per day, but it was a fight every time. It was the same content they would be doing at GT, but without the GT structure, and it did not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">But once the kids started at GT, those same iXL lessons became a game for them. I remember taking the kids to the park one day after school. They asked me, &ldquo;Instead of playing can you set up a hotspot so we can do a few more lessons? I want to earn more GT-Bucks!&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Was it bad that they were being bribed to do lessons? 76% of Americans would think so. But it definitely worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">My middle daughter &ndash; who is the most driven by money &ndash; has completed more than two full grades of school in ~20-weeks (60% of the school year), and shows no signs of slowing down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">I have not noticed any reduced interest in learning outside of school. My oldest daughter does not like the idea of incentives at all. She doesn&rsquo;t need the incentives and she thinks other kids shouldn&rsquo;t need to be incentivized either. But the incentives </span><span class="c9 c14">are</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;helping with her younger siblings, and, even if they aren&rsquo;t pushing her to go harder, they definitely don&rsquo;t seem to be </span><span class="c9 c14">hurting</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;her internal drive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">Incentives, Incentives Everywhere</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">In addition to the core incentive system, the schools have been testing two new ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Part way through the school year at the GT school they created an incentive system to drive non-academic behavior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">In this system, called &ldquo;Dojo Points&rdquo;, kids earn Dojo Points by being pleasant, respectful team-players. The guides give out the points in qualitative ways when the kids demonstrate perseverance, teamwork, respect, autonomy, and when they give and receive feedback to each other. More so than the GT bucks, my kids will come home and tell me how many Dojo Points they earned that day. A high day is somewhere around six points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The kid in each &ldquo;section&rdquo; (split between the older and the younger kids) who earns the most Dojo Points in a day becomes the daily &ldquo;Dojo Master&rdquo; and gets a &ldquo;key&rdquo;. At the end of the week, assuming no ties, there are five keys divided among the kids in each group. On Friday the kids are presented with a bunch of locked boxes. One of the boxes has a prize in it. The kids with keys check the boxes to see if their key opens the box with a prize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The system seems to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">My 6-year old can often be disruptive in many settings, including at school, but lately he has turned a corner at school and has been winning the daily Dojo Master (this week he has won four of the five days so far, and almost has a lock on the Friday prize).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Will he start mis-behaving more as soon as he loses access to the incentive? Maybe. He definitely misbehaves at home from time-to-time and has trouble regulating when things don&rsquo;t go his way. Is his regulation now better than it was before he was put on the incentive program at school? I think so? But maybe that is just a function of him getting older and he would have been getting better anyway? Another example where it would have been nice to have a twin brother we could have experimented on I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">While GT was focused on non-academic behavior Alpha set their sites on another problem that schools face: </span><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">Summer regression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Educators have long known about the summer regression problem &ndash; kids tend to atrophy or regress over the summer break (this is worse for less privileged children, but true for all kids). We have not had our summer with GT yet, but last summer the Alpha school ran an experiment where kids who completed lessons in the summer were paid real money (US dollars &ndash; not &ldquo;Alpha bucks&rdquo;). They were given $1 per lesson completed over the summer (effectively 10x what they make during the school year). Recall that generally during the school day kids who &ldquo;hit their minimums&rdquo; complete about 10 lessons per day over 2-hours. So any kid who kept that up on their own over the summer could earn $10/day for 2-hours of work ($5/hour). Not bad for a 6-year old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">The Public Relations challenge</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">As Alpha is expanding its program beyond its own school it has, understandably, focused on the &ldquo;AI-powered 2-hour learning&rdquo; product. It is that tool that </span><span class="c9 c14">seems</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to be what differentiates Alpha from all the other schools in America. The tool lets kids learn 2.6x faster. But from my experience the tool is necessary but not sufficient. The tool provides the </span><span class="c8 c9">means</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;for kids to advance and learn quickly, but it does not provide the </span><span class="c8 c9">motivation</span><span class="c25 c9">. The rest of the school has been built around providing the gaps that the tool misses &ndash; both the need to increase student motivation, but also any other gaps that come up. If the 2-hour learning tool is the self-driving car, the incentives are the fuel, and the rest of the school is the human behind the wheel who makes sure the self-driving car isn&rsquo;t caught in a loop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">So what happens when Alpha takes their core product and pushes it somewhere without the infrastructure that goes around it? It still works, but just not as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">In the way that Alpha measures effectiveness (see next section) students in the Alpha school advance 2.6x faster. Kids at the GT-school advance ~5x faster (mostly due to the selection effect of the kids they bring into that program). In the homeschool program the school is piloting with the exact same software (but without the supporting infrastructure, guides and incentives) the students are advancing at ~1x speed. That doesn&rsquo;t seem awesome, but remember that is with just 2-hours of academics per day, not a full day of classes. Good but not great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The Alpha team is trying to figure out how to improve the performance of the kids in the home school pilot before they expand it beyond the beta testers. I expect the answer will be related to the incentives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c94">Part Five: Does it work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Alpha claims 2.6x average learning speed versus traditional schools, but what does &ldquo;learning speed&rdquo; mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Even the Alpha guides get confused sometimes.

My 8-year old started 2nd grade content in mid-October 2025. She &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; all of 2nd grade by March 31st, 2025 (Reading: March 31st, Math: February 5th, Language: January 20th). She is now working her way through 3rd grade and the system estimated she will master all 3rd grade content before the end of May (Language: May 23rd, Math: May 9th, Science: May 7th). When she completes this content she will start on 4th grade material for the remainder of this year, and will start next school year part-way through that 4th grade content (assuming she doesn&rsquo;t finish 4th grade over the summer). Since she missed the first 20% of the school year, we could say she is &ldquo;learning&rdquo; at (2.1/0.8) ~2.6x speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">But that is NOT where the 2.6x number comes from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Instead Alpha defines 2x learning as improvements in students MAP scores - </span><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">MAP Growth Speed (MGS)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">For those who are not deep in academic terminology (I know I wasn&rsquo;t), MAP stands for </span><span class="c8 c9">&ldquo;</span><span class="c19 c8 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nwea.org/map-growth/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169943997&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zL4oyobdioIjUlM6PyRfJ">Measures of Academic Progress</a></span><span class="c8 c9">&rdquo;</span><span class="c25 c9">. MAP is a set of standardized, computer-adaptive tests built by the Northwest Evaluation Association given to millions of students across America three times per year (fall, winter and spring). The adaptive nature of the test means that, while the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; of the test depends on the student&#39;s age/grade level, the test questions increase or decrease in difficulty (of both concepts and expected knowledge) as students answer questions correctly or incorrectly. This means that not only can you compare scores across students in the same grade, you can compare scores of the same student over time, and of students across different grades. A 12th grader scoring a &ldquo;238&rdquo; has about the same knowledge as a 5th grader scoring &ldquo;238&rdquo;. If that score was a MAP math test taken in the fall, the 12th grader would be at the 60th percentile for his grade and the 5th grader would be at the 97th percentile for hers &ndash; but their knowledge and current capabilities would be about equivalent to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Alpha has their students take the MAP tests three times per year. This testing can help the program adapt to understand if students who are &ldquo;getting through the material&rdquo; are actually retaining it and conceptualizing it, but it also helps measure progress. If a student is at 95th percentile in math in the fall, the MAP test will tell us if they are still at 95th percentile in the spring (or if they have advanced slower or faster than other 95th percentile students across the country).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">You can see all of the </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teach.mapnwea.org/impl/NormsTables.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169947219&amp;usg=AOvVaw0N4h3ZJPQfGLhljHZguR9q">MAP percentile charts here</a></span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;for all the kids who take it across America. For our purposes let&rsquo;s look at the MAP percentile scores for math tests taken in the spring for the top 50% of kids in the country:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 439.00px; height: 798.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 439.00px; height: 798.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">A few things worth pointing out:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_urhrby1hbos6-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Everyone gets better.</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;Whether due to education or not, the scores of any given percentile increase with each passing year</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">Everyone slows down. </span><span class="c25 c9">Students get rapidly better on the test in the early years of school, and that progress slows down as they get older. Kindergarten to 1st grade sees increases of ~20 points at most percentile ranks. 11th to 12th grade improvements are minimal. Even the best students at that age are only getting ~6 points better on the test, and the median student sees no improvement at all over 12th grade.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">The best kids slow down the least.</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;From Kindergarten to first grade everyone is advancing at about 20-points on the test, so the more average kids are actually improving faster on a percentage basis than the top-1% kids. But around middle school something happens. From 7th to 8th grade the top percentile kids gain 7-points on the test. The 50th percentile kids gain 3-points. The lowest percentile kids (not shown in that image) only improve by a single point (from a much lower base)</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c9">The top performing kids are WAY ahead of the average and the lower tier kids.</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;The kids at the top percentile achieve the median score of a graduating senior by the end of 3rd grade! And recall this is not an IQ test &ndash; this is a content test. The top 1% of 3rd graders have more content knowledge and comprehension than the median high school graduate.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">When Alpha says their kids are learning 2.6x faster than kids in traditional schools, what they mean is that Alpha kids are increasing their MAP scores 2.6-times faster than similar kids at traditional schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">What that means in practice is that kids at Alpha improve their percentile ranking on MAP results every time they take the test. If a 3rd-grader at Alpha scores a &ldquo;209&rdquo; on Math in the Spring (71st percentile), you can expect she will achieve (on average) a 235 the following spring when she is in 4th grade (traditional 71st-percentile 3rd graders improve ~10 points, so her experience at Alpha should have her improve 10 x 2.6 = 26 points). That would jump her from 71st-percentile to 94th-percentile. Keep it up and by 5th grade she moves beyond the 99th percentile (if you are lost with the math, don&rsquo;t worry. The point is just that Alpha kids are learning faster, and increasing their &ldquo;relative rank&rdquo; with the rest of the country as they spend more time at Alpha)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Note that because of the base rates, it is a lot easier to improve versus your peers at traditional schools when you are &ldquo;average&rdquo; and when you are older. Median kids do not advance as fast, and older kids do not advance as fast &ndash; so getting a 2.6x improvement is easier in absolute magnitude when you start low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">So we should expect that the GT school &ndash; where kids enter the program scoring in the 90th+ percentile &ndash; might have faster overall improvement, but a smaller delta from traditional schools where the top percentile kids are still advancing very quickly. That would have been my ingoing hypothesis. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">What is surprising is that, with the caveat that the GT-school is both new and small (only five kids took both the fall 2024 and the winter 2025 tests), those few data points are pointing in the opposite direction: on average those five kids&rsquo; MAP scores improved </span><span class="c8 c9">5x faster </span><span class="c25 c9">than other kids who started the year at those base levels. The absurdity of those numbers makes me think that that rate will not hold, but it makes me optimistic that the program might actually speed up bright kids&rsquo; academics even more than it helps the average kid. Since my kids started the school year late in October (rather than mid-August when the standard school year started), they missed the fall MAP testing and we only have a single data point for each of them &ndash; the Winter MAP. They will be taking the Spring MAP in the next few weeks and I will be happy to share how they have progressed when I have that data back. I think they will have improved, but I am skeptical it will be at 5x faster than other similarly bright kids across the country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">There are at least three other objections to using MAP scores to measure progress or &ldquo;success&rdquo; of academic programs:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_ixtft9dago8t-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Do MAP scores actually correlate to anything important later in life?</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Is this all just &ldquo;teaching to the test&rdquo;?

What about critical thinking, formulating long-form thoughts through essays, and other types of learning?</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">How effective are other elite-schools and learning programs at increasing MAP scores?</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I do not want to get bogged down in any of those questions, but all deserve at least courtesy answers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">Do MAP scores correlate with anything important?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">I am not aware of any studies that look at MAP score correlations to lifetime income or other adult measures of &ldquo;success&rdquo;, but MAP scores are highly correlated with </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nwea.org/uploads/2020/10/MAP-SAT-College-Readiness-Benchmarks_NWEA_linkingstudy.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169953930&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ShxUyZr57jxJtAdOzCosI">SAT scores</a></span><span class="c9">, </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/roadmap-success-using-state-assessment-data-predict-postsecondary-success&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169954131&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tenGB__aFXp3Ok2TVWDf9">post-secondary success</a></span><span class="c9">, and likelihood to attend an </span><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elmbrookschools.org/uploaded/SSMigration/data/files/gallery/ContentGallery/NWEAcollegereadinessindicator.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169954276&amp;usg=AOvVaw167tg4lFZzKJPhCwoz4qTP">elite college</a></span><span class="c25 c9">. MAP is not trying to measure the same thing as SAT, but it&#39;s not surprising they are correlated. It begs the question of whether improving a MAP score will improve other things you care about (SAT scores, getting in a good college, having a happy life), but it is at least indicative that it is not measuring something meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">Are scores inflated because of teaching to the test?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I believe there is something to the concern about &ldquo;teaching to the test&rdquo;. The kids doing the Alpha program spend a lot of time learning how to take multiple choice tests based on the content they have learned, and the content they are learning is the same content that is being tested on MAP. The best way to get better at a thing, is to practice doing that thing. To the first level of approximation this is fine as long as you are testing the right thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">You see this effect in competitions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">If you want to get a high score in a diving competition, the first step is learning how to dive and how to dive better. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about what the final test will evaluate you on, because no matter what it is evaluating you on, you need to be able to enter the water head first without making a splash and there are some fundamental skills you need to learn in order to do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">But once you get to be a very good diver, then you may find the judging criteria starts to influence what you practice, how you practice, and what you choose to demonstrate in competition. Does one type of dive tend to score higher for any given level of skill? If so, you should focus your practice on that style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">That type of &ldquo;over-optimization&rdquo; tends to only happen at the highest levels of competition (if you want to get good at Jeopardy, start by having a large knowledge base. Once you are very good, THEN you may want to use frequency charts to fill in likely gaps (do you know all your alcoholic drink ingredients?), learn &ldquo;pavlovs&rdquo; (Pop art = Warhol; </span><span class="c9 c70 c148">Aguinaldo = Philippines; two fathoms = Mark Twain</span><span class="c25 c9">) and study bidding strategies for daily doubles &ndash; things that will get you better at the &ldquo;Jeopardy test&rdquo;, but not get you better at the underlying skill that Jeopardy is, in theory, testing you on).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">It is possible that Alpha&rsquo;s learning methods veer into &ldquo;over-optimization&rdquo; but I have not seen that in practice. Mostly they are in the &ldquo;learn the material you are expected to learn, and then you will test higher when you are tested against that material&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The remaining &ldquo;teach to the test&rdquo; concern is &ldquo;are we testing for the correct things?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">There I </span><span class="c9 c14">do </span><span class="c25 c9">have some concerns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The MAP tests seem to be very effective at assessing knowledge and ability to incorporate that knowledge in novel situations. What MAP is not testing are things like:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_6u4pv89pdilx-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Writing essays</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Long form planning and strategy</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Public speaking and persuasion</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Making connections between two disparate concepts or ideas</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Deep understanding of the drivers of history</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Psychology</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Economics </span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c25 c9">Leadership</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">&hellip;and so many other things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">100% of MAP test questions are multiple choice. Where are the students learning deep thinking? What about the learning you get from small group discussions in a university seminar?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I think Alpha&rsquo;s answer to that concern is &ldquo;that is what we do in the afternoon workshops&rdquo;. I think that is a fine answer. How well do most schools teach those things as a baseline? Maybe Alpha does as good a job as other schools teaching public speaking. Maybe they do a better job? But what is missing is an objective measure of how well they do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I can see that GT is making progress on the measurement of those softer skills by running workshops on &ldquo;competitive academics&rdquo; where the output is legible. The kids at that school don&rsquo;t just learn to give talks, they give talks and then submit them to The Moth in an attempt to qualify for (and win) Storytelling Nights. They don&rsquo;t just write persuasive essays graded by their teachers, they write persuasive essays and then submit them to national competitions. They don&rsquo;t just learn the concepts of long term planning and strategy, they put them in practice playing go and chess and then compete against their peers and earn an elo ranking. I think it is a fair way to assess these things and leads to more accountability, but note that it is only happening at the GT school with ten kids, not the main Alpha campus, and the data points so far on whether it is working are very thin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Our friends at the flagship school are less convinced that the climbing wall workshop is teaching those &ldquo;non-state mandated&rdquo; academics that the core program misses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Another disappointment is &ldquo;Alpha Writes&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">The school was not happy with the third-party reading and writing apps out there and built their own. Alpha Reads is excellent. Alpha Writes (which is newer and just launched about a month ago) is not. I believe the school (and </span><span class="c9 c54">Joe&#8239;Liemandt) understands that the product is not good enough, and they are taking it back to the drawing board, but for now I do not think the Alpha kids have any real edge versus traditional schools in their training on essay or creative writing skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c9">How do Alpha&rsquo;s MAP score improvements compare to other selective private schools across the country?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">This is an important question for some parents. It is great if you can expect your 5th grader to advance 2.6x faster than they would at the local public school, but if you are planning to spend $40,000/year to send him to Alpha, your alternative is likely not the local public school. And if you are considering moving your family to Austin for the school, your alternative options are places like Horace Mann, Harvard-Westlake, and Lakeside. How does the 2.6x improvement that Alpha is delivering compare to those elite institutions?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I have no idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Unlike Alpha I have not found any elite school who has shared the MAP improvement rate for the students at their school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I expect these elite schools are very good for all the reasons the selective private school I sent my kids to before GT was good: They have a select group of peers, they have great teacher:student ratios, and they have incredible resources. I also expect most of these schools do NOT accelerate (I could very well be wrong here and would be happy to be corrected). If they are like the schools I am familiar with they allow their students to advance through the material at the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pace, with the normal pedagogy, but, because those kids are so bright, that leaves them plenty of time for enrichment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lakesideschool.org/uploaded/2024-2025_US_Curriculum_Guide.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153169962457&amp;usg=AOvVaw199g0AzIkSYr6QZAm6JR9q">Lakeside school </a></span><span class="c25 c9">(where Bill Gates children attended) has classes where students write and perform one-act plays at the school&rsquo;s annual festival; advanced photography courses where students develop their own signature style and brand; Literature classes on Victorian novels, the Harlem Renaissance, and Chaos Theory; classes on abnormal psychology, architecture, blockchain, game theory and wilderness survival and leadership.

As Caplan says, the most important parenting decision you can make that will affect how your kids turn out is your choice of spouse (or more accurately your choice of the genes you use to build your kids).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">Caplan does put one caveat on his data: </span><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">range restriction.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">He admits that all of his adoption studies focus on middle class Americans (and Europeans).

Chetty had access to all IRS filing data for generations. He was able to focus on families with multiple children that moved to significantly different zip codes, and follow those children over extended periods of time. By having millions of data points he could tease apart the impact of moving to a &ldquo;better&rdquo; zip code for older vs younger siblings. The younger sibling had the same family environment (and 50% of the same genes), but some number of more years in the &ldquo;better&rdquo; neighborhood.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Chetty found that better neighborhoods made a difference to long term outcomes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">But isn&rsquo;t the neighborhood where a family lives in a &ldquo;shared environment&rdquo;? Clearly some adopted families lived in better neighborhoods than others? Why didn&rsquo;t Caplan&rsquo;s adoption studies pick that up?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">I think part of the answer is noise. Chetty had millions of data points vs hundreds of thousands for the adoption studies. But mostly I think the reason Chetty found this impact while the adoption studies did not is that he was looking for different things. No one took the adoption studies and grouped the zip codes as the relevant input variable.

He initially considered training them to be genius artists, writers or mathematicians, but decided those fields were not objective enough. It would be too easy for critics to dismiss his future children&rsquo;s achievements and &ldquo;not genius&rdquo; no matter what they accomplished in those fields. So he chose a field that was considered both &ldquo;driven by intelligence&rdquo; that had clear, objective measures: chess.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Then he called his shot.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">By 1989 all three girls received their first &ldquo;GM norms&rdquo; (a GM norm is finishing a tournament with a elo score of at least 2600; 27 norms are needed to make grandmaster). Two went on to become grandmasters - the 3rd and 4th women to ever achieve that title. One ranked in the top 100 (all genders) at age 12 &ndash; she peaked at #8 in the world. The other became the top-rated woman in the world at age 15.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Polgar showed that you could take kids, at least kids with &ldquo;good enough genes&rdquo;, and turn them into world champions through the right education methods.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">One might think this would be &ldquo;case closed&rdquo;, but even as the Polgar sisters were achieving these feats people were saying that these girls must have been &ldquo;naturally gifted&rdquo;. They clearly had bright parents, but does anyone think that if they had been adopted into a random middle class American household they would have still become chess geniuses? Or world class in anything at all?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">When Polgar was challenged on exactly that, he wanted to repeat the experiment by adopting a &ldquo;black child&rdquo; and doing it again. Unfortunately his wife talked him out of it. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">Even if he had adopted a child and turned him into a genius, that would just be one data point &ndash; it would not show up in Caplan&rsquo;s adoption studies.

I was in conversation with a couple that I had just been introduced to. He asked why we moved to Austin, &ldquo;Was it for your job?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">&ldquo;No. Actually we moved for a school for the kids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Their faces expressed a combination of confusion and shock.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">It wasn&rsquo;t the first nor the last time.

Yes, that figure is </span><span class="c56 c9 c14">all&#8209;in</span><span class="c5">: every Chromebook, every afternoon workshop, even the spring junket to Poland to beta&#8209;test the platform with Ukrainian refugees is baked into tuition. There are no gala auctions or booster fees waiting in tall grass. Still, $40k is a hard swallow when the local Christian school will take your child for eleven. Worse, the number almost certainly fails to cover costs. Recall that guides start at $60k, rise to $100k on promotion, and the five &ldquo;head guides&rdquo; each earn $150k. At the five&#8209;to&#8209;one student&#8209;to&#8209;teacher ratio Alpha runs, those salaries alone suck in half the revenue from a twenty&#8209;kid cohort before you&rsquo;ve paid the rent, the head of school, the company executives, the curriculum designers, the engineers that are building the 2-hour platform and AlphaRead, the workshop costs (or the trip to Ukraine) or the marketing expenses (MacKenzie has a very well produced podcast, and I see a lot of ads for the school on Facebook now that we live locally).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c56 c9">Compared with aristocratic one&#8209;to&#8209;one tutoring, forty grand is a steal.

Don&rsquo;t most people and employers value &ldquo;innovative thinking&rdquo;? Maybe, but not in their new hires.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Elite employers generally want bright, diligent hires who will color inside the corporate lines for a few years before they start &ldquo;thinking outside the box&rdquo;. Most successful businesses are successful for a reason. They want new employees to enter and do what they are told to in order to understand their new business before they try to &ldquo;do things differently&rdquo; and change things.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Caplan explains that the need to signal conformity is the hardest hurdle to disrupting education. You can signal intelligence with an IQ test, and you can signal conscientiousness with any sort of time consuming long term task (Caplan gives the example of collecting the largest ball of string in the world). But by definition, if you do anything different from the norm of going to an existing well known school, you are signalling non-conformity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Caplan himself homeschooled some of his kids, but only after he verified that homeschooling for high school wouldn&rsquo;t hurt his kids chances of getting into good colleges. He was non-conformist, but only willing to act on the non-conformity if it wouldn&rsquo;t be punished by the conformists.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Most people are not even going to go as far as Caplan. Most people are very happy to be conformists.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">That conformity is one reason why humans surpassed chimps. We are really good at watching other high status members of our communities and copying their behavior. I believe that is a big part of why moving to a better neighborhood leads to better outcomes for kids &ndash; because both the kids and the parents take on the &ldquo;better&rdquo; lifestyles of that community.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">But it also means that getting people to switch from the existing school system to something like Alpha will be difficult.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Once we, personally, got over the more pedestrian concerns about moving for a school, our next concern was whether our kids would even get into Alpha. We did not need to worry. Alpha does have a screening process. They won&rsquo;t accept kids who are disruptive and can&rsquo;t focus in front of a computer for 20 minutes at a time. But the bar is relatively low.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">And yet the school is still, after more than a decade in operation, under-capacity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">When other elite schools have 20% or lower acceptance rates &ndash; and limited &ldquo;entrance points&rdquo; (i.e. get your kid in at kindergarten or you are likely out of luck), Alpha is taking almost everyone who applies and allows students to jump in at any point &ndash; even mid-year.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">That reality replaced our first concern with another: Do we want to join a club that will so easily accept us as a member?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Both my wife and I came from a world where:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Low acceptance rate ~= quality</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c56 c9">We had just assumed that if </span><span class="c56 c9 c14">we</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;believed Alpha was worth moving across the country for, the school would be oversubscribed with local families. But it&rsquo;s not even close.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c56 c9">The hardest schools to get into in Austin are places like </span><span class="c25 c9">St Stevens and St Andrews &ndash; veritable institutions more than 70 years old. Those are the schools that the rich, old money families who have been in Austin for generations want to send their kids to. And if that is where the elite are sending their kids, why wouldn&rsquo;t you want your kids in the same place? We already know that peers matter and that education differences are marginal at best &ndash; why not just optimize for the best peers (where best means the most exclusive club)? St Stevens and St Andrews are the best socially acceptable options: not this new weird Alpha school that uses AI to teach kids.

Then what?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">For many the next questions become:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Will this help my kid get into a great college?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Does knowing this material faster help them get a better job post-college?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Does learning this material faster make them happier and more fulfilled in life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c56 c9">For me, the real value that comes from Alpha is not the performance uplift. The most important feature of Alpha is that they have found a way to learn more </span><span class="c56 c9 c14">efficiently</span><span class="c5">. It allows students to condense all the &ldquo;required&rdquo; state-mandated material into half a day for ~6 years instead of a full day for ~13 years. Is that the right stuff to learn? Are they learning all they need from that platform? That almost doesn&rsquo;t matter. The point is that the alternative is to spend more than twice the amount of time to get to the same (or worse) output.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Once you have freed up half a day for 6-years and a full day for the other seven, you open up a limitless number of possibilities.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Some kids will rush into college classes. Some will choose to use the time to play sports. Some will use the time to master chess or quiz bowl or programming. Some will take time to travel the world with their families.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c56 c9">I have some opinions on where I think </span><span class="c56 c9 c14">my</span><span class="c56 c9">&nbsp;kids should spend the extra time that has been freed up, but those opinions are secondary to that much stronger opinion that it is good to give kids more time to do </span><span class="c56 c8 c9">something</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;other than sit in classrooms and learn state-mandated material.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">I believe the most important gift I can give my children is the gift of my love and respect.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c56">Once I have done that, I think the next most valuable thing I can give them is </span><span class="c56 c8 c9">time</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">The 2-hour learning platform is gifting them an additional ~9 years of childhood.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">I just hope they use it wisely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c10 c79" id="h.blou69ad0ke4"><span class="c24">Airships: A Tech&#8209;Tree Branch We Let Wither</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c3">I like to imagine the state of technical progress as a tech tree in a video game. The digital age tech tree is cool, with advancements like the internet and now and, built on top of it, AI, but I can&rsquo;t help thinking about the tech paths we let wither on the branch. &nbsp;Take airships: a century ago they crossed oceans in Art&#8209;Deco salons, then vanished in a flash of hydrogen and bad headlines. Today armed with carbon&#8209;fibre frames, electric drivetrains and a climate mandate we may finally have the points to re&#8209;unlock that branch.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Airships can cut CO&#8322; by 90&#8239;% on regional cargo runs. Here&rsquo;s how we lost and may regain this tech branch.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">As this is a review of airships, I should acknowledge my bias. I think airships are very cool. So much so that I spent a considerable amount of time building one in Minecraft. </span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 457.00px; height: 242.64px;"><img alt="" src="images/image48.jpg" style="width: 457.00px; height: 242.64px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">This airship has lightning rods to prevent re-creating the Hindenburg disaster.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.6ujebi36fjjg"><span class="c25 c39">I The Glory Days </span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">As most technologies began, airships were developed through the military. These airships made their debut during World War I. This was surprising to me at first, wouldn&rsquo;t they be easy targets for early airplanes? A few shots into their hydrogen cells, and they&rsquo;d be done for.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Yet militaries found plenty of niche uses: fleet scouting, city bombing, U-boat hunting, shielding cities, and even serving as early warning radar stations. Eventually, every one of these roles would be taken over by faster, tougher fixed-wing aircraft or missiles, but for a time, airships ruled the skies.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">There was a man named Hugo Eckener who had a plan to take this technology and repackage it into luxurious cruises of the sky for the well-to-do.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">At the time, the Zeppelin company was running out of money, they would need a large win if they wanted to continue existing. Its senior captain, Hugo Eckener, who had started as a journalist writing about zeppelins, knew how powerful a good story could be. He pitched a bold idea: he would captain the Graf Zeppelin, LZ-127, around the globe faster than anyone ever had before. He reached out to newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst, offering exclusive rights to the story in exchange for funding. Hearst loved it and invested $200,000, half the project budget and about $3.7 million in today&#39;s money. In return, he placed four of his own correspondents aboard and insisted the trip start and end in Lakehurst, New Jersey, his hometown. He also required the trip to be branded as a &quot;Hearst stunt.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Eckener pieced together the rest of the budget through grubby little deals like selling souvenir airmail stamped and pre-ordered by collectors for each leg of the journey.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">But this was still a huge gamble. A crash or even bad press could void Hearst&rsquo;s payments, spook insurers, and scare off future financiers. If successful, however, it would show the world that zeppelins were a safe and reliable luxury travel option of the future.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 363.00px; height: 261.68px;"><img alt="" src="images/image116.jpg" style="width: 363.00px; height: 261.68px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The Dining area of the Graf Zeppelin</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The journey was risky. In California&rsquo;s Mines Field, hot landing surfaces reduced hydrogen lift so much that the airship couldn&rsquo;t take off. Eckener had to remove six passengers and reduce fuel, food, and spares to shave weight. Even then, it was barely enough. He ran the engines at full emergency power, and the 776-foot hull surged forward. As the stern dipped, it struck the ground and tore fabric on the lower fin. The ship narrowly avoided power lines and climbed to safety. Riggers crawled along the internal catwalk to patch the tear mid-air.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">This was just the beginning. The voyage continued in August, peak season for North Atlantic storms. Eckener dodged thunderstorms and squall lines while navigating with 1920s radio, which often failed in lightning. He reverted to sextant navigation whenever sunlight broke through. Hearst&rsquo;s newspapers ran hourly updates as all this unfolded. Every detour while likely lifesaving, shaved fuel margins and risked their goal of fastest circumnavigation.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Still, Eckener reached Friedrichshafen in 55 hours and 22 minutes, just four hours behind schedule, setting a new nonstop distance record for an airship.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The Graf Zeppelin completed the trip in 21 days and 33,234 kilometers, the fastest circumnavigation at the time. Crowds cheered the crew on arrival. Eckener received National Geographic&rsquo;s gold medal, and the success helped secure funding for the Hindenburg.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.infrhsfbtc1b"><span class="c25 c39">II: The Hindenburg</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c14">May 6&#8239;1937, Lakehurst Naval Air Station.</span><span>&#8239;Hindenburg is minutes from docking after a 3&#8209;day Atlantic hop.

In 2013, with Google booming as an advertisement monopoly, Brin, a Google co-founder, quietly funded LTA Research, eventually spending an estimated $250 million to build the 124-meter Pathfinder 1 at NASA&rsquo;s Moffett Field. The idea began in 2014 when he visited Moffett&rsquo;s museum and saw the skeleton of the USS Macon, a 1930s airship. The sight sparked the dream of resurrecting efficient, giant dirigibles.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Brin&#39;s team worked in secret for nearly a decade. The NDA shield allowed them to develop carbon-fiber structures, advanced avionics, and hydrogen-ready powertrains without competitors or media scrutiny.

In that sense, the 2013&#8209;onward revival isn&rsquo;t a fad; it&rsquo;s the natural moment for a second audition after a catastrophic first act. </span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.tbv3032a0tc6"><span class="c25 c39">IV Quick Definition</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">So, what are airships?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">An airship is a type of lighter-than-air aircraft that can be steered and propelled through the air using engines and rudders. It stays aloft by the buoyancy of a gas, either helium or hydrogen, which is lighter than air. Some, like the Goodyear blimps you might have seen, have no internal structure and rely on internal gas pressure to maintain shape. Semi-rigid airships, on the other hand, include a partial framework, often a keel or truss along the bottom, which reinforces the envelope and allows for heavier loads and larger size. This review focuses on the semi-rigid variety, exploring why they disappeared and how they could make a comeback.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.c0g7uawbr7t"><span class="c25 c39">V Design Challenges</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">As a mechanical engineer, what fascinates me are the design trade-offs modern airships face.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>First, there&rsquo;s the lifting gas. Helium is safe but expensive and in short supply, around $390&ndash;550 per thousand cubic feet in 2025. </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/helium-supply-crisis-2025-global-impact/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170004805&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mDJUZLqk_uYX7IvrSIJoJ">Export helium</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;now rides on three liquefied natural gas hubs: Qatar, Algeria and Russia&rsquo;s Amur making every plant outage or Strait&#8239;of&#8239;Hormuz scare a market shock.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Hydrogen is abundant and can be produced through electrolysis and it provides about 10% more lift than helium, but its explosive nature means developers need to bend over backwards with safety systems. Modern design has every hydrogen cell being double&#8209;walled in Mylar, with an inert nitrogen buffer between skins so that any leak meets nitrogen, not oxygen, before it can mix with the airframe. Spark-proof electrical systems are also needed to reduce risk of igniting the hydrogen. If we can manage the safety problems however, hydrogen is the most scalable path forward for airships. Currently, designers of modern day airships are using helium-based designs as the first step, while hydrogen propulsion is a highly coveted future upgrade.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Buoyancy control is another challenge. If an airship offloads a heavy cargo load, and if nothing is done the ship becomes positively buoyant and tries to shoot sky&#8209;ward. Classic fixes like venting gas or taking on ballast are wasteful or logistically hard. The modern solution is to compress helium into tanks and backfill the envelope with air from the atmosphere. But this requires energy, creates heat, and needs intercoolers. </span></p><p class="c10"><span>Ironically what makes hydrogen so appealing as a lifting gas makes it much worse to be able to compress. Hydrogen&rsquo;s density at 1&#8239;bar is </span><span class="c14">half</span><span>&nbsp;helium&rsquo;s, so to pack the same </span><span class="c14">volume</span><span>&nbsp;of gas into a small space you must go to 7 to 10 times the pressure. Some designers sidestep high&#8209;pressure tanks with </span><span class="c14">variable ballonets</span><span class="c3">: onboard blowers pump outside air into flexible internal balloons, trading lift for a small weight penalty in minutes without venting precious gas.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>A more experimental idea is </span><span class="c14">steam&#8209;condensation trim</span><span class="c3">, where water ballast is boiled off for ascent and re&#8209;condensed for landing, no gas compression at all.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Regulatory barriers also loom large. </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lynceans.org/tag/darpa/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170007390&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oODleVd6aZkXBDwGd9WC-">Neither the FAA nor EASA</a></span><span>&nbsp;has a mature airship certification framework.

It requires that any cargo shipped between U.S. ports must be carried on U.S.-built, -flagged, -owned, and -crewed vessels.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>The result? A 2 to 3 times cost increase for American shipping. For territories like Puerto Rico, this translates to higher consumer prices. </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cato.org/research-briefs-economic-policy/effect-jones-act-puerto-rico&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170008342&amp;usg=AOvVaw30abmhk0u-bOmez7jgWBcJ">A study on Puerto Rico</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;found the Jones Act alone adds about 1% to their household costs.Given that the Act is unlikely to be repealed anytime soon, airships might fill the void.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>In Canada, Nunavut faces similar challenges.

The break-even freight rate is estimated at $2 to $4 per kg, well below scheduled air freight.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Airships can match truck speeds and reach locations without runways or highways, all while using much less energy.

Recently I saw a post showcasing a conceptual design of a new nuclear powered airplane that would be used for sky cruises. The picture looks absurd, a great big behemoth of absolute excess:</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 433.83px; height: 289.52px;"><img alt="" src="images/image31.jpg" style="width: 433.83px; height: 289.52px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The only trouble with this design is that we had already had this type of luxury air cruises back in 1920 with the Graf Zeppelin that circumnavigated the globe! We have forgotten this and are now trying to reinvent it in new silly ways. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I want them to come back. Floating through the sky in a giant blimp scratches that steampunk itch. It would feel like witnessing a real, imaginative leap forward.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.few1tbz6yaay"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.yi8s1h1ukq2h"><span class="c24">An American football game</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c39"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">The year is a couple years ago. I am nineteen, and on my first trip stateside. Michael Moore, whom I was forced to watch in English class, once said in an interview that he omitted some details about the Scandinavian prison environment from his documentary &ldquo;where to invade next&rdquo; because American audiences simply wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it. Here I am, a Scandinavian in rural Illinois, facing the opposite dilemma. Everything about this trip is so unbelievably American, in an honestly mostly negative way. Not all negative, but mostly. I tried so hard to be open-minded and delete all stereotypes from my brain before landing in Chicago airport, only to have them continuously confirmed from the moment I landed. My boyfriend&rsquo;s former host family, who we were staying with, wanted to drive us somewhere we could walk to in five minutes (on a sidewalk, no &ldquo;b-but walkability!&rdquo; excuse). &ldquo;Freedom Gas Station&rdquo; is adorned with a Liberian flag. One house makes it clear that it roots for Trump in 2024, while his neighbor believes that love is love and water is life. There are three fast food chain options in a town of less than 2000 and all three are delicious. Yet the most American experience, except perhaps the party where we started target shooting cans for fun, was yet to come. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">One day, we headed to the nearest college town to watch a local football game. Or, we&rsquo;re driven, because neither me nor my boyfriend can drive, which of course is a serious handicap. I knew so little about this American pastime that until earlier that same year, I thought the Super Bowl was a bowling competition, but I figured it must work the same as all the other ball sports. Run (or ice skate, or gallop) around the field, get the ball in the goal. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">It didn&rsquo;t. But that didn&rsquo;t really matter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Live American football games are so overwhelming, so overstimulating, so </span><span class="c9 c14">much</span><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;that I really struggle to explain it in words. I figure it must be like what old people feel TikTok is like. No wonder the ADD boyfriend I was with loved it. American football is not only football, but approximately 10 other things happening in the span of a couple minutes. Because the game constantly pauses (?), something must happen during the breaks. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">It was freezing cold. American winters are, in many areas, notably more harsh than Southern Scandinavia, which is where the vast majority of us live. The cheerleaders were in leggings, gloves and scarves with the team logo on it. But the sexy dancing girls were not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">One type of dancing girl is apparently not enough, so during one of the constant breaks, a different group of way more scantily clad dancers popped out of their blanket cocoons and started a short performance to an outdated pop song. They gave it their all, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I do agree with the Americans in that respect - the more sexy dancers, the better. The entrepreneurial, always striving, never satisfied, spirit of the American people strikes yet again. You invented cheerleading and still thought, no, not enough. You don&rsquo;t consider yourself Icarus, able to fly too close to the sun; after all, you&rsquo;ve already gone to the moon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Another break. I&rsquo;m trying desperately to make sense of the game but failing. Luckily, buff military dudes come to the rescue. They&rsquo;re starting to do push ups on the side of the playing field. The audience is informed that Guy 1 graduated from this university two years ago and is now proudly serving in the navy, while Guy 2 is doing some kind of joint military and college program right now. We all clap and cheer at their push-ups and their service. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">During the game, we&rsquo;re treated to uplifting orchestral music from a uniformed band, interspersed with cheerleaders cheering, outdated pop songs and enthusiastic commentary from someone who is sponsored by Toyota. I know this because he will end every other sentence with &ldquo;and a Toyotaaaaa!&rdquo;. As in: &ldquo;the Redbirds are coming back strong, and a Toyotaaaaaaa!&rdquo;. At first I thought I had misunderstood, this isn&rsquo;t my first language and I&rsquo;m tired and distracted. But no, that was just how they chose to integrate the sponsorship, and I respect that immensely. No nonsense. No hiding. Also, how did they get Toyota to sponsor a game with two minor teams and and audience of at most 300 people? I don&rsquo;t care. But I loved it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">I almost forget there&rsquo;s even a game happening. I&rsquo;m hooked to see in which corner of the field another random seeming group of people will pop and dance or do push ups. The points, shown on a big screen, are way higher than what I&rsquo;m used to in the other types of sportsball (this, I have learned, is what Americans who don&rsquo;t care about sports call it. I think that is hilarious and I will steal it). I&rsquo;ve finished my pretzel bites, a fulfilling snack consisting of the whitest, softest dough I&rsquo;ve ever put in my mouth. The &ldquo;cheese&rdquo; dip I got to accompany them was downright awful, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">Now, there&rsquo;s a long break, similar to what I already know from real football. I wanted to grab more pretzel bites, but right as I&rsquo;m about to get seated, the band starts to march down the field. It&rsquo;s a diverse orchestra with a wide array of instruments. Next, what I can only describe as the &ldquo;flag girls&rdquo; come in. They carry long strips of colored fabric on sticks that they do tricks and formations with. It&rsquo;s not very entertaining, but it&rsquo;s somewhat heartwarming. In the US, I learned while there, there&rsquo;s a stereotype about &ldquo;band kids&rdquo; as being nerdy and awkward. In this activity, they&rsquo;ve managed to include not only the jocks and the pretty girls, but also the sexy girls, the flag girls, the military and the nerds. There&rsquo;s a great sense of community and togetherness. It&rsquo;s a small game with two pretty unknown teams, but there&rsquo;s nothing humble about it. Americans don&rsquo;t do humble. They do great. And everyone is allowed to participate in this project of greatness, in their own way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c9">All in all, I cannot recommend this experience highly enough. Whether you&rsquo;re a tourist like me or a born and bred American who&rsquo;s just a sportsball hater, do consider going to a local college American football game. There&rsquo;s something for everyone in there. Even if you hate balls and pretty girls and sexy girls and the military industrial complex and the education system, you get to laugh at the absurdity of it all. And unlike when watching a soccer game, you&rsquo;re at no risk of getting a beer bottle smashed in your head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c9"></span></p><h1 class="c20 c36" id="h.ouo5zbbhrw0r"><span class="c24"></span></h1><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.oqaqai4q1pam"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.xacf8rpp5ycg"><span class="c24">Arbitraging Several Dozen Online Casinos</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c14">The Vicious Subsidy </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The growth of gambling in the United States is unrelenting. This blog regularly plugs prediction markets, ESPN now shows moneylines, and even relatively conservative areas of investing blur the line through options sold to retail and event contracts. I dislike this for several reasons. The first bookies promote poor thinking in their customers to make better marks. Secondly, crypto used to mean cryptography and I already had a hard enough time justifying weird number puzzles to normal people. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But the biggest reason it bothers me is that so much of society is already focused on money. Not positively either, a large portion of my friends and family struggle to pay the bills or put off important things like retiring or having children for a lack of funds. Even if I do alright, a lot of people don&rsquo;t. Making even more of life a pecuniary proposition rubs salt in social wounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But if the game happens anyway, I should get good at the game. There are many complicated and sophisticated approaches to making money at gambling. You can get very good at your chosen wager, like so many famous poker players. You can get better at modeling the world, as Edward Thorpe [0] and Bill Benter [1] famously did. Or you can cheat. I would lose my day job if I cheated, but the first two are viable. It takes wits, nerve, and statistically normal luck, but there&#39;s still good money to be made in gambling. What I did not realize is that there is an additional option. You can show up and casinos will pay you to play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So while most stories about gamblers focus on their risk taking or cleverness, this review focuses on bottom feeding. Nothing here requires any skill, the most sophisticated mathematical operation needed is division, and the most exciting action is a credit card application. But the money is real. With no upfront capital, you can make about $18 per day. The median American makes $42,220 per year [2], which is $116 per day. So an extra $18 is a significant amount. If you have a credit card you can push that number up to at least $30000 per year, which is approaching minimal financial independence[3]. Double that number for a married couple. That money goes very far in the cheap seats of America. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Finally, I wish to talk about the low hanging fruit of gambling profits because it is very strange to me that there is a moderately sized pile of money lying in the street. Online gambling is evidently profitable, despite the fact that the house is literally offering to buy everyone in America roughly a used car every year. How much money do gamblers in aggregate have to be losing to make this possible? How bad are normal people at math? Did I just get lucky or is it skill?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.xjqhek83lvld"><span class="c25 c39">Stylization</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The facts here are stylized. I have chosen to omit details on both my personal earnings from online gambling activity and how these arbitrages work in detail. Such as games chosen, sites used, scripts written, or other tricks of the trade. I did this for two reasons:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. Arbitrages are rivalrous. If you make the money, the odds of me making the money go down. I will still probably regret advertising that this opportunity exists, but there are already more detailed guides on the net, if not on sites with as large or as competent of an audience. Figuring out how to do this yourself is just a matter of finding websites and reading sales pitches, but I will not do that for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. Some of you shouldn&#39;t be doing this, you have better things to do with your time. My hobbies already included several adjacent things and I have to itemize my taxes to deduct charitable donations anyway, so I had minimal additional costs. I also already know how to program computers and solve software problems, so automating is easy enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.y41u1asem9c1"><span class="c25 c39">A Legal Fiction</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">To begin, we need to identify our targets. These are sweeps casinos. In the United States, a sweepstake differs from a lottery by fulfilling no more than two of the following conditions:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">A: It is a game of chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">B: It has a valuable prize.</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">C: You have to pay to enter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Since casinos don&#39;t like skilled customers and gamblers want their bets to be meaningful, C is most commonly dropped. Sweepstakes as a marketing gimmick, such as the famous McDonald&#39;s Monopoly game, are quite common. But those kinds of sweepstakes aren&#39;t trivially exploitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sweepstakes Casinos exist to offer online, onshore gambling in the United States by exploiting a simple loophole. Instead of operating as a normally regulated gambling provider, they offer games where the prizes have no cash value. You can purchase in-game currency which cannot be exchanged for valuable prizes (normally called Gold Coins or GC) and are also given, free of charge, a promotional currency that can be exchanged for cash (Sweeps Coins or SC) after it is played in a game. The prices for GC are highly variable, but the amount of free SC is pegged to the amount of real USD you paid for your GC. So the SC is legally not the main concern, but in practice it is the only thing I or almost all players care about. The GC is just there as a fig leaf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For example, a sweeps casino will sell 100,000 GC and 100 SC for $99.99. After purchase, the 100 SC are not redeemable. To cash out, redeemable SC must be won in a game. So if you put all 100 SC on black in roulette and win, you can cash out $200. Redeemable SC can also be played in a game, but all casino games have negative expected value. If you want to make money, you want to play each SC the fewest times possible, ideally once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will this legal fiction hold up in court? Maybe, since the law is increasingly determined by who got there first. Whether they will get big enough to capture the Uber exemption is an open question for another time. I expect the entirely legal online casinos to eventually outcompete their sweeps counterparts, for the simple reason that they pay more tax revenue. If the lottery is a tax on fools, our publicans will not abide being undercut forever. But for review purposes, the sweeps casinos pay this year and that&#39;s good enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.h2fnbiqlysh1"><span class="c25 c39">Meet Alice</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We have to assume a few things about a hypothetical customer of a sweeps casino with a few particular traits. Let&#39;s call her Alice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A: Alice is American. Alice lives in the US, is a US citizen, and can freely access US financial services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">B: Alice is unexceptional. Alice has no notable skills, can do arithmetic, browse the internet, and keep records.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">C: Alice plays for keeps. Alice does not enjoy gambling, but does like to get paid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alice is a useful basis of comparison. Everything I describe will be well within the reach of a person with minimal computer skills. I don&#39;t count as an Alice, since I know too much about math, but you should think of a minimally technically competent person. Consider her something like the &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.y2dckhutesm4"><span class="c25 c39">Free Edge</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alice has no connections or special insight. Nevertheless, she has several sources of advantage over the house. The house gives them to her, in the form of several mathematically demonstrable edges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Edge 1: No Purchase Necessary</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Her first money making method exists to maintain the sweeps casino&rsquo;s legal fiction. Almost all casinos give a &quot;Daily Bonus&quot; which includes SC. This is to clearly emphasize that they do not require money to play their games, it is only highly recommended. Alice will log into her account each day and collect her bonuses. She will store these up for a while, play through a game, and cash out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The size of these bonuses vary between .05-1.15 SC. Cashing out normally requires 50 or 100 SC, so it can take up to 2000 days (or 5 years, 5 months) to get enough free SC to cash out in the extreme cases, not accounting for losses in games. Still, the average site pays .5 SC, so this is ~$18 per day. Alice can collect 15% of the median American&#39;s earnings, with minimal time and effort. This money also excludes additional seasonal or holiday bonuses, which can add up quickly around Christmas time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Edge 2: Discount Dollars</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alice isn&#39;t content with her minimal income and wants more. To do this, she engages in the dark art of statistical arbitrage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Her plan is simple. A casino offers her a deal where she can purchase 100 SC for $75. She has no special skills, but the casino offers a game where she will win, on average, 95% of what she plays [4].</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">i. She buys the package for $75 via credit card and receives 100 SC.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">ii. She plays 100 SC and wins 95 SC.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">iii. She cashes out 95 SC for $95.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">iv. She pays a $75 credit card bill.</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">v. She now has $20 more, more than one day&#39;s worth of daily bonuses. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In my experience, the amounts of discounted SC here vary. Sales are concentrated around holidays, weekly &quot;Happy Hours&quot;, and other events. The size of the discounts are also concentrated in the 5-15% off range instead of the 25% off in the example. But, I netted $36 per day in the last month on this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Edge 3: Hey Big Spender</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Once Alice started spending money, casinos started noticing her. Online gambling, like online gaming, is built around whales. A few, high value customers dominate casino returns. As a paying customer, Alice is statistically more likely to be one of these whales and therefore receives some extra perks. A few free dollars here, an extra discount package there, these incentives can add up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The discount packages are already folded into my daily discounts, but the additional rewards add another $4 to the daily total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Edge 4: What&#39;s in Your Wallet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Finally, Alice totals her bill at the end of the month and notices that her gambling did something weird. If you use a credit card at a physical casino, it almost always codes as a cash advance and does not receive credit card rewards. But as &quot;I can&#39;t believe it&rsquo;s not gambling&quot;, the sweepstakes casino purchases are treated like any other in-app purchase. So she got a small rebate, call it 2% (or more, if you can get the right cards).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In total, I net about $35 [5] per day with a suboptimal [6] card setup. This includes purchasing some undiscounted packages where, after accounting for the credit card reward, I still have an edge. I am rate limited by my credit limit, payment processing times, settlement times, and a desire to limit counterparty risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.v2sk1fxrdtia"><span class="c25 c39">Sources of Loss, Variance, and Annoyance</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Online casinos offer many kinds of games. Most of these are bad for arbitrageurs, for reasons that make them good for the target audience. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">First, casino games often celebrate wins, even if they are less than the amount staked. Each win can play animations, sounds, and other effects that can&#39;t always be disabled. This takes valuable time, but can mostly be ignored or run in the background. Alice wants no fuss, she does not enjoy this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Second, games have uneven payouts. Gamblers seem inherently attracted to the possibility of winning a lot of money, which economists call a preference for lottery like payouts. The ideal game for a skilless arbitrageur has a very small edge and zero variance. Remember, talentless edge is capped to the upside. You expect to make at most 10% off a 10% discount. So a great game would be a machine that takes in $100 and gives out $99. Meanwhile, a slot machine takes in $1, gives back nothing two thirds of the time, a quarter a quarter of the time, and a range of dollar bills for the remainder. That uncertainty is annoying and it can make it much harder to profit, especially in the short run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Variance can be overcome by betting more, since the central limit theorem turns high variance games into normal distributions eventually. But that requires betting small amounts frequently, which takes time. Alice is here for the long run and wants to get there as quickly as possible. So she&rsquo;ll make those bets, but would prefer not to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Third, games require engagement. Some slot machines have &quot;bonus rounds&quot; that require input to trigger. Or blackjack, where the player can make &quot;meaningful&quot; choices, even though the optimal decision is known [7]. These are all terribly inconvenient and some websites have semi-effective anti-botting measures that make them worse. Alice cannot deploy bots, since she is skill free, so she&rsquo;ll have to play games herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So, here is a ordered subjective list of the notable games in my experience, along with their expected value</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Baccarat: 98.94%[8]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Baccarat, No Commission [9]: 98.76%</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">French Roulette: 98.65%[10]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Blackjack: 99.34%[11]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">European Roulette: 97.3% [12]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Plinko: 97.1%, variants can be lower</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Other Traditional Games (Sic Bo, Top Card, Teen Patti, etc) 94-96.7%</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dice [13]: 95%, can be lower</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Slots: 85%-97.2%, can rank above Dice and Plinko</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The traditional casino games are clearly better than slots for the arbitrageur. Baccarat and French Roulette both offer high payouts with very little required engagement. This renders both of them superior to Blackjack in my opinion. That last .4% of payout isn&#39;t worth the hassle and increased variance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I would also like to take a moment to praise Roulette as a triumph of game design. The house edge on roulette is entirely attributable to the &quot;0&quot; spot on the wheel and all 37 numbers can each be bet on with the same 35 to 1 odds. This allows for both the degenerate gambler and conservative arbitrageur to play the same game at the same time with vastly different amounts of variance. One can try to cover the board with as many bets as possible to minimize the chance of losing anything, while the other will stick everything on one number for that sweet pseudo jackpot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.trcp2z3lqte7"><span class="c25 c39">Uncompensated Risk</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There are two main sources of uncompensated risk for an arbitrageur. You can screw up and the casino can screw up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You can screw up by entering suboptimal instructions. Setting a game to autoplay 1 SC instead of .1 SC can cost serious money when you do it 1000 times. But, theoretically, this doesn&#39;t exist. Execution is a real part of arbitrage, but one that is hard to manage. Skill issue, etc. These don&rsquo;t count as skills, so Alice won&rsquo;t be concerned with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The casino can screw up by not paying you. Technical glitches (coins not awarded with purchased packages, failed games, unclear rules) can normally be resolved by complaining to the bot until you get routed to an underpaid support worker who just wants you to go away. Alice will be polite, but insistent, and document everything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The more serious issue is if the casino stops existing or never existed. Since your coins don&#39;t technically have cash value, cutting and running is a potential problem. This is unlikely for any given casino, since they are (ideally) going concerns, but is an unavoidable risk. You start by not paying casinos which lack a history of paying out. Hopefully casinos would pay out winnings the next day, but several take one or two weeks. Anything more than a month is a serious problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Counterparty risk is a good reason why an arbitrageur would bother talking to other gamblers. If the jackpot winners aren&rsquo;t getting paid, the casino isn&rsquo;t good for the money and Alice can pass. This isn&rsquo;t foolproof, but nothing is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I have realized this counterparty risk. A casino stopped paying out with a few hundred dollars of my winnings unpaid. This is, of course, undesirable. But there are additional options for recovery. Since I always pay by card, I was able to dispute the charges and recover what I put in. I had to fill a whole lot of digital forms and even mail some letters, but I got my money back. Counterparty risk is the largest risk and can only be managed by limiting trust to counterparties. This, more than my credit limits, determines how much I can make off credit card rewards. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.2jjwr2dfq1m5"><span class="c25 c39">Paying Dead Money</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So that covers the strategy. You can make about $95 ($18 from daily bonuses, $36 from discounts, $4 from additional VIP rewards, and $35 from credit card rewards) per day. That adds up to 82% of the median American&#39;s annual earnings. This takes, generously, an hour a day, if you do all the collecting and playing manually. A household can double this number. The median American household earns $80,610, so a couple can earn 86% of what a typical household earns in the US off gambling incentives, excluding benefits such as PTO, health insurance, etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I am excluding any gambling where skill could be beneficial from this estimate. Sports betting is off the table here, as is advantage play in other games. But since your typical American doesn&#39;t beat the house, sports betting rewards, incentives, and other subsidies could provide additional income in any realistic scenario. Similarly, poker, prediction markets, and other advantage gambling is not unrealistic for a moderately skilled (rather than zero skilled) individual. Your takeaway should not be that &quot;gamblers can make a living&quot;, it should be &quot;any US citizen who can browse the internet and use the financial system can make tens of thousands of dollars a year with minimal effort&quot;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.t6gaq4pibbtd"><span class="c25 c39">What if you had a UBI and nobody came?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is the part of the review where we wildly extrapolate what we&rsquo;ve learned to the rest of society. Here are some conclusions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1. For a large chunk of America, they could earn more money by doing less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">About 40% of American households earn less in a year than a subset of gambling companies will pay them to show up and do as little as possible. This isn&rsquo;t a free lunch, but the required labor is very low. It takes under half an hour a day, call it an hour if you are bad at computer things. No physically stressful labor and you don&#39;t have to get dressed. You do have to itemize your taxes (if you are spending money on discounted coins), and that could affect whether an individual qualifies means tested benefits such as SNAP [14]. But some of these sites are offshore and don&#39;t properly report winnings to the IRS. I pay my taxes (I&#39;m a good boy), but I know some people don&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Of course, a mousetrap offers a pretty good meal for the mice. The chunk of cheese sitting right on that trigger is an excellent source of calories. The issue is eating it without the snap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2. Something prevents most of the populace from collecting their money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Clearly Alice is not representative of Americans. We can now ask what parts are miscalibrated. Free money exists for a reason. There have to be some sort of costs associated with picking money up off the sidewalk that keep it there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">i. Ignorance. Most people don&#39;t know you can do this. Gambling still has a stigma and most people don&#39;t go looking for online casinos to make money. So ignorance is an easy answer. Slow or intermittent rural internet could also be a problem. Some of these casinos have been around for a decade or more, but proliferation takes time. This knowledge limitation doesn&rsquo;t really lower the bar for Alice in the long term, she would eventually learn there&rsquo;s a buck in this racket.</span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">Of course, Alice could not know because society suppresses information about gambling, even if profitable. In this view, the recent growth of the industry is a historical abnormality and typical social dynamics discourage discussing it, especially in elite circles. Most people mistrust a financial advisor who claims &ldquo;the solution to your budget shortfall is to go into credit card debt to fund a slot habit&rdquo;, even if that is demonstrably true. But why these social dynamics exist is the next question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">ii. Discipline. The vast majority of the bets that casinos offer will lose money over the long term. People just won&#39;t limit themselves to playing the absolute minimum amount and gamble more than they should. That is what the casino expects and it seems to work. But the fact that it works is interesting.</span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Instability. Because you aren&rsquo;t supposed to be arbitraging, any given casino can stop paying at any time. They could drop table games and you&rsquo;re stuck with slots or stop offering redeemable SC altogether. The portfolio of casinos is more resilient, but perhaps it just isn&rsquo;t worth the effort to sign up for dozens of predatory, unofficial, pseudo-gig economy apps. This would prevent Alice from centering her personal finances exclusively on casino arbitrage, but would not prevent people with full or part time jobs or other financial support from picking up extra cash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">iv. Downside Aversion. Alice is converting a lottery-like activity (jackpots) into a bond-like stream of payments ($95 per day). All of the risk of arbitraging is to the downside, since a casino could vanish or Alice could fat finger a bet. But the payouts are small, paid over long periods. To paraphrase, everybody wants a Lambo, ain&rsquo;t nobody wants to clip them tedious coupons. Since the best case is making a little bit of money and the worst is losing a lot, Alice must have atypical preferences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">v. Numeracy. The population of numberers is bad by the numbers. We can use the PIAAC (Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies) [15] to get a grip on this. If arbitraging casinos requires Alice &ldquo;to identify and act on mathematical information and ideas embedded in a range of common contexts where the mathematical content is fairly explicit or visual with relatively few distractors&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s a level 2 task and 34% of Americans cannot do it. If the information is &ldquo;less explicit, embedded in contexts that are not always familiar and represented in more complex ways&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s level 3 and 62% of Americans can&rsquo;t. Levels 4 and 5 exclude 88% and 98% of Americans respectively. My guess, figuring how to do this out is a level 3 task, executing a solved problem a 2. But I am a professional numberer, so my intuition is likely wrong. In either case, a significant fraction of adults cannot be expected to do basic arithmetic.</span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c3">vi. Social Pressure. The purpose of employment is not only money, but also social status and respect. Answering &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; with &ldquo;Pick cheese out of mousetraps&rdquo; is unlikely to one up anyone at parties. Of course, Alice doesn&rsquo;t have to tell people. She can honestly say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a financial analyst and investor specialized in alternative investments&rdquo;, then deflect further questions. But that may take social skills she does not have. America&rsquo;s social environment where most people work may not have caught up to the fiscal realities. &nbsp;Of course, if she has a day job she can just answer with that. I personally don&rsquo;t tell people I do this, the rewards are low and the risks are high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3. Minimally disciplined and numerate Americans have a high income floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I should emphasize again how little effort collecting any of this money takes. You can work most of it out in about an hour. Executing it is a chore that takes a small amount of time each day. I have put more work into writing this than I have into collecting the money for the past month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So, if you are an American, can count, and are willing to work (generously) 4 hours a week, you can make about $166 per hour. Therefore, Americans who will take low financial risks, do elementary school math, and chores are so rare they command a massive, implicit premium on their time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt Levine&#39;s wonderful Money Stuff [16] newsletter sometimes talks about Astrophysicists; STEM PhDs, Technologists, and Quantitative Traders all basically do the same job. They look at data, model things, and make decisions. The math they do isn&#39;t always fun or interesting. In my experience, interestingness and profitability are uncorrelated for mathematics. But quantitative skills nevertheless convert to cash. They&#39;re what make skilled edge, positive expected value bets that the house doesn&#39;t just give you, possible. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But showing up is enough to make money. The low end of the Astrophysicist continuum is sparse. If you combine extremely small amounts of risk taking, discipline, and the ability to count in our society, you can keep a roof over your head. This is what a society&#39;s garbage time looks like. Some minimally productive individuals don&#39;t have to do anything challenging to live decent lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unintuitively, this lowers my estimation of the skills of people who actually get rich from risk taking and numbers. Capitalism is begging them to do so. Our institutions are beating down the doors for someone, anyone who wants risk and rigor. If the distribution of talent is constant in a population, we are lowering the average skill of the Astrophysicist class to expand the total size of the pool. If talent is not constant and we are increasing the total number of Astrophysicists, that has to have opportunity costs at a societal level. Time spent coding is time not spent composing poetry, encouraging gambling discourages something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Simultaneously, gambling is at best zero sum, unproductive entertainment. All of my profits must be someone else&rsquo;s losses. Perhaps it increases knowledge of how to build statistical models, but solving basic strategy Blackjack is not an open question on the frontiers of human knowledge. The gambling industry removing a larger fraction of Astrophysicist effort means that effort is not going to actual Astrophysics. My intuition is that financial services and big tech are less marginally helpful for long term societal benefit than actual Astrophysics, but that is far less certain. If that is true, we have a system that takes more bucks, but gives less bang. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I believe this situation is unstable. You may utilize the apocalypse of your choosing, but the odds that we have arrived at an infinite frontier of milk and honey are low. So I will be taking the money and saving it for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But this subsidy hastens the end. Society requires the disciplined and numerate, at least for now. Offering them and only them to trade tedium for cash is not a great way of solving problems. Vice has found a way to remove a few more virtues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp#Applied_research_in_casinos</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Benter</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[2] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[3] https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/, their baseline assumption is $25k.

Brennan instead proposes replacing these negative goals (in the sense of &ldquo;things you want to </span><span class="c14">avoid</span><span>&nbsp;doing&rdquo;) with positive ones (in the sense of &ldquo;things you want to </span><span class="c14">do</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;), such as &ldquo;I want to be a good parent to my kids&rdquo;, &ldquo;I want to help people&rdquo;, &ldquo;I want to get a raise&rdquo; and so on. It&rsquo;s strange to think of someone born in a vegetative state who never undertakes actions of any kind before dying without having done anything good or bad being morally superior to an ordinary person who does their best but inevitably makes some mistakes along the way: but taken to its logical conclusion, that&rsquo;s exactly what slave morality implies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Once I&rsquo;d grasped the concept, a bunch of disparate trends in modern politics and culture (from environmentalism and effective altruism, to medicine and social services) snapped into focus, and I now feel like I have a much fuller comprehension of the animating principle undergirding all of them.

Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also a film which has become a go-to example of &ldquo;separating the art from the artist&rdquo;, for which any praise must be heavily qualified and prefaced by acknowledging that, whatever its artistic merits, the film&rsquo;s director later committed an</span><span><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170072346&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uwgOy_AGB_TD3X8RtontT">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170072461&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Wa5efMIIJtjGxLnNNmRF-">unspeakably heinous crime</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for which he faced minimal repercussions, legal or otherwise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>With that out of the way, a synopsis. In Los Angeles in the 1930s, Jake Gittes is a private detective and former police officer who specialises in matrimonial work (</span><span class="c14">i.e.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;investigating his clients&rsquo; spouses for possible infidelity). A woman named Evelyn hires him to spy on her husband Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the city&rsquo;s water department. While surveilling him, Gittes learns that Mulwray is vetoing a new proposed dam for safety reasons, and was witnessed having a loud public argument with a man named Noah Cross. Gittes surreptitiously takes a photo of Hollis embracing a young woman, and the photo is leaked to the media, embarrassing him. A woman he does not recognise confronts Gittes in his office, and explains that she is the real Evelyn Mulwray: the other woman was a prostitute hired to impersonate her. Shortly thereafter, the police uncover Mulwray&rsquo;s drowned corpse in a reservoir, and Evelyn hires Gittes to investigate his death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the course of his investigation, Gittes is warned off by two thugs from the water department. Gittes learns that Hollis once owned the water supply privately, along with his father-in-law Noah Cross (Evelyn&rsquo;s father), but Hollis subsequently decided that the water ought to belong to the public, contrary to Cross&rsquo;s wishes. Gittes meets with Cross, who informs him that the young woman Gittes photographed with Hollis has gone missing, and offers to double the fee Evelyn has offered him if Gittes manages to track the young woman down. Gittes gradually uncovers a plot to buy up huge tracts of land in the Northwest Valley under assumed names, by sabotaging the existing landowners&rsquo; farms and forcing them to sell their land for a fraction of its value. He suspects that Hollis was murdered when he uncovered the plot. After escaping some thugs sent to kill them, Gittes and Evelyn return to Evelyn&rsquo;s house, where they have sex. Evelyn answers the phone in the middle of the night and leaves the house; Gittes discreetly follows her to her butler&rsquo;s home, where he witnesses her with the young woman he photographed with Hollis, apparently forcing her to take tranquillisers. When Evelyn emerges from the house, Gittes accuses her of holding the woman hostage, which Evelyn denies, insisting that the woman is her own sister, Katherine, and that she is holding her there for her own protection. Gittes subsequently learns that, owing to the presence of saltwater in his lungs, Hollis could not have drowned in the reservoir: he must have been drowned elsewhere, and his corpse moved. Returning to Evelyn&rsquo;s home, he finds a pair of glasses in the saltwater pond in her garden, and infers that Hollis was drowned in the pond and his body subsequently dumped in the reservoir. He drives to Evelyn&rsquo;s butler&rsquo;s home, notifies the police of the address, then accuses her of drowning Hollis in the pond and withholding information from Gittes. Evelyn confesses that Katherine is both her sister </span><span class="c14">and</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;her daughter: her father, Noah Cross, raped her when she was fifteen. She also tells him the glasses he found in the pond are not Hollis&rsquo;s. Gittes realises that Cross must have drowned Hollis in the pond, and during the struggle his glasses must have fallen in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gittes arranges for Evelyn and Katherine to flee to Mexico by car, then escapes from the police and summons Cross to Evelyn&rsquo;s house. Cross reveals that his plan is to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the city, then irrigate it using water from the reservoirs. Gittes accuses him of murdering Hollis, but Cross retrieves the glasses from him by having one of his thugs hold him at gunpoint. Gittes is forced to drive Cross to his agreed rendezvous point with Evelyn in Chinatown. Unfortunately, the police are waiting and detain Gittes by handcuffing him to a car. Desperate to escape, Evelyn shoots Cross in the arm, hurriedly bundles Katherine into a car and drives away. The police open fire, fatally striking Evelyn in the head. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, and the police order a traumatised, practically catatonic Gittes to be released.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Polanski and Towne&rsquo;s intentions with </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;were many and various: for one, subverting the </span><span class="c14">noir</span><span>&nbsp;genre by using its established tropes to mislead the audience. For example, on a first viewing, the viewer will probably assume (as Gittes does) that Evelyn is a sinister </span><span class="c14">femme fatale</span><span>&nbsp;like Phyllis Dietrichson in </span><span class="c14">Double Indemnity</span><span>, when in fact she is likely the most sympathetic and morally upstanding character in the entire film. For his part, Polanski thought that, using the new creative freedom afforded to he and Towne by the repeal of the Hays Code, an unambiguously tragic ending was the only way the film could transcend its fate as a superficial </span><span class="c14">noir</span><span>&nbsp;pastiche.</span><span class="c8">[2]</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But where does the slave morality enter into it? The key to understanding film&rsquo;s worldview, in my opinion, comes in the scene after Gittes and Evelyn return to Evelyn&rsquo;s home after escaping from the thugs, and Evelyn asks him the last time he found himself in a comparably dangerous situation:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;In Chinatown.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn: </span><span class="c3">What were you doing there?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Working for the district attorney.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Doing what?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;As little as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn: </span><span class="c3">The district attorney gives his men advice like that?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;They do in Chinatown.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">[some time later]</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Why does it bother you to talk about it?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;It bothers everybody who works there&hellip; for me it was just bad luck.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t always tell what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Evelyn:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Why was it bad luck?</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8">Jake:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I was trying to keep someone from being hurt, and I ended up making sure that she was hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The entire exchange, naturally, foreshadows the film&rsquo;s ending. &ldquo;As little as possible&rdquo; are also Gittes&rsquo;s last words in the film, as he stares at Evelyn&rsquo;s bullet-riddled corpse and reflects on how, once again, his thoughtless blundering into a situation beyond his understanding has resulted in harm coming to a woman he cared for. Screenwriter Robert Towne based the line on </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)%23Script&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170080434&amp;usg=AOvVaw15rMZ_FFPag58eFITqd0zF">a conversation he&rsquo;d had with a Hungarian vice cop</a></span><span>&nbsp;who had worked in Los Angeles&rsquo;s Chinatown. Dealing with a confusing m&eacute;lange of rival gangs speaking in varying dialects, the police officer came to the conclusion that the &ldquo;police were better off in Chinatown doing nothing, because you could never tell what went on there&rdquo;, and the police had no way of knowing whether their interventions were helping the victims of crime in the area, or furthering their exploitation. The film&rsquo;s profound cynicism about the ability of law enforcement to rectify societal ills is made particularly explicit in an </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://assets.scriptslug.com/live/pdf/scripts/chinatown-1974.pdf?v%3D1729114886&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170081156&amp;usg=AOvVaw2K0itmR77oVPSyX0cc9e-3">earlier draft of the screenplay</a></span><span>, which features a line ultimately cut from the film. In the film&rsquo;s opening scene, Gittes is presenting an unrelated client named Curly with evidence of his wife&rsquo;s infidelity. A distraught Curly announces that he&rsquo;d like to murder his wife, but Gittes dissuades him, noting that &ldquo;you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody and get away with it&rdquo; &ndash; and &ldquo;rich&rdquo; Curly certainly is not. Towne later admitted that he </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228190917/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/09/local/me-54369/3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170081777&amp;usg=AOvVaw3wLEVxTruk0CerjunxGz9B">regretted removing the exchange</a></span><span class="c3">, arguing that it foreshadowed the entire movie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The worldview presented by </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;is one in which the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must. Any efforts taken by the powerless to remedy or ameliorate this state of affairs is doomed to failure, as they will find their actions ultimately in unwitting furtherance of the nefarious goals of the wealthy and powerful. In such a situation, one&rsquo;s best bet is simply to do &ldquo;as little as possible&rdquo;, hoping that, by so doing, you can at least take solace in the knowledge that you did not exacerbate an already bad situation. It is, in effect, a film about a private investigator, in which the act of investigating causes nothing but destruction and ruin. Lest you think I&rsquo;m exaggerating, Towne expounded on his intentions for the film in a </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9644/remembering-chinatown-screenwriter-robert-towne&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170082934&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WWaBzmtPnYzMI1PUAjeC2">1988 interview with </a></span><span class="c19 c14"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9644/remembering-chinatown-screenwriter-robert-towne&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170083026&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CUYH1EJk8ESeGkmkxBv8L">NPR</a></span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c122 c6"><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;itself, I guess, is a sort of metaphor for the </span><span class="c8">futility of good intentions </span><span class="c14">[emphasis mine]</span><span>. You simply &ndash; individual actions don&rsquo;t necessarily matter even though we&rsquo;d like them to, even though we&rsquo;d all like to be like Rambo and think we could singlehandedly </span><span class="c14">[sic]</span><span>&nbsp;win a war that we lost. And </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;suggests that a good man or a man who is not necessarily good all the time but would like to do something decent has his hands full when he tries to disentangle the Gordian knot that is really the kind of thing that most of us have to disentangle if we&rsquo;re going to do anything decent.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c122"><span>And most of us &ndash; ever since we&rsquo;ve seen popular entertainments like James Bond, where he&rsquo;s licensed to kill, have always felt that, yes, we&rsquo;ve kind of worshiped the job. It&rsquo;s a dirty job, but somebody&rsquo;s got to do it. We got to get those &ndash; you know, we&rsquo;ve got to destroy the city in order to save it. We&rsquo;ve got to win at all costs. And I think that you have to reach a point where you say, do I have to win at all costs? Is it &ndash; </span><span class="c8">am I going to be saving more than I&rsquo;m destroying? </span><span class="c14">[emphasis mine]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Now, I&rsquo;m sure there is not a man alive who would dispute that &ldquo;be mindful that your well-intended actions may backfire or carry negative consequences you did not intend&rdquo; is fundamentally sensible advice. Likewise, the assertion that &ldquo;the wealthy and powerful sometimes commit heinous crimes with impunity and get away scot-free, while a poor person who did the same thing would feel the strong arm of the law&rdquo; &ndash; everyone, at every point on the political spectrum, would surely agree that this is true at least some of the time (hell, the film&rsquo;s director is a living example thereof). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But with his talk of the &ldquo;futility of good intentions&rdquo;, it is my opinion that Towne carries these observations far beyond their logical extremes and ends up in an ugly, fatalistic (or perhaps quietist) destination. It is one thing to assert that our actions can sometimes inadvertently bring about consequences we didn&rsquo;t want, and that powerful, evil people may stand to benefit from these consequences: it is quite another to assert that, therefore, one should only do the bare minimum, and that doing any more than that is more or less guaranteed to make a bad situation even worse. This neatly ties in with Ozy Brennan&rsquo;s explanation of what slave morality really entails: doing &ldquo;as little as possible&rdquo; is an activity that corpses notably excel at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Freddie deBoer describes this attitude as </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/against-political-calvinism&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170086164&amp;usg=AOvVaw14NNI15c26wsVbS45tCjAM">political Calvinism</a></span><span>. In the Calvinist branch of the Protestant faith, a certain number of individuals called the &ldquo;elect&rdquo; are predestined to go to Heaven after they die, while others are condemned to Hell. Because their respective identities are predetermined at the outset, no decisions anyone makes in his lifetime will have the slightest bearing on his ultimate destination in the afterlife. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do: your fate has already been set. deBoer was writing this in the summer of 2020 in the context of the then-ascendant Ta-Nehisi Coates/Ibram X. Kendi school of antiracism, which routinely makes assertions to the effect that &ldquo;the United States (and, by extension, the West) is irreparably stained by the sin of white supremacy, and nothing we do will ever make the slightest difference to changing that basic fact&rdquo;. This certainly </span><span class="c14">sounds</span><span>&nbsp;like a radical statement, as does </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s implied message of &ldquo;we are impotent in the face of the rapacious whims of the wealthy and powerful: the best we can hope for is not to inadvertently aid and abet their dastardly schemes&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But in reality, both statements are conservative and passive to their core. To be a progressive presupposes that progress is possible. But if progress is impossible, then there&rsquo;s no good reason to be politically engaged or even to try to make a positive change in your immediate local environment. You can rot in your bed scrolling on Instagram all day long and end up no worse, morally, than someone who devotes every waking minute and every spare cent to trying to help the less fortunate. Sufficiently advanced cynicism, then, is indistinguishable from complacency. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Perhaps </span><span class="c14">Chinatown </span><span>might benefit from being </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/11/read-history-of-philosophy-backwards/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170088269&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Szejxg8jlUHcu3zSP8G2C">read backwards</a></span><span>, or considered in light of its presumed intended audience.

Maybe Towne intended the film as a much-needed corrective to the then-widespread (I assume) idea that good intentions, in and of themselves, are sufficient to bring about positive change: a wake-up call to busybodies who meddle in other people&rsquo;s affairs, to the direct detriment of their intended benefactors. But just as there are many </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170089084&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xZvFwvB7uPHOIT6JEdxcs">pathologically selfish people who might read </a></span><span class="c19 c14"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170089176&amp;usg=AOvVaw0v_9ILk0yhVfz8BBT7al8Y">Atlas Shrugged</a></span><span>&nbsp;and come away from it thinking that it vindicates their lifestyle choices, there might equally be many pathologically passive, inert individuals who watch </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;and feel reassured that they have made the right choice not to even </span><span class="c14">attempt</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to help those around them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But I must confess: Towne&rsquo;s comment about the &ldquo;futility of good intentions&rdquo; inclines me to believe he intended the film&rsquo;s message as a universal one, rather than contingent. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder which came first: the realisation that intervention carries unintended consequences, followed by the decision to hence remain passive and disengaged &ndash; or </span><span class="c14">vice versa</span><span>? Perhaps movies like </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;are what happens when you wake up in a swanky mansion, but are still acutely, uncomfortably aware of how much suffering there is in the world &ndash; but you feel no especial urge to devote any time or effort to attempting to ameliorate this state of affairs, particularly not if doing so would prove disruptive to the lifestyle to which you&rsquo;ve become accustomed. As always when one finds oneself afflicted with cognitive dissonance, one has a choice to either change one&rsquo;s mind or change one&rsquo;s behaviour. But changing one&rsquo;s behaviour (in this case, becoming more politically engaged, helping the less fortunate, actively trying to improve the world) is difficult and costly: it&rsquo;s far cheaper to concoct elaborate psychological defense mechanisms with which to rationalise your decision to be politically disengaged and passive. Slave morality steps in to fill the gap: &ldquo;if you intervened, you would only make a bad situation worse: ergo, your decision to do nothing is the best choice available, and therefore, you are morally superior to those who tried to help&rdquo;.</span><span class="c8">[3]</span><span>&nbsp;Or as The Last Psychiatrist</span><span class="c8">[4]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/06/amy_schumer_offers_you_a_look.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170091066&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rZq6qr3guodJ4ZJaB_L6Z">might put it</a></span><span>: it&rsquo;s extremely easy to continue practising the same destructive behaviours you always have, while ostentatiously announcing how much doing so makes you hate yourself &ndash; far more difficult to actually </span><span class="c14">change</span><span>&nbsp;your behaviour.

The game was marketed as a modern military shooter in the vein of contemporary commercial heavyweights like </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c14">Battlefield</span><span>, in which the player typically controls an American soldier sent to fight in a Middle Eastern conflict. Inherent to the subgenre is an implicitly positive attitude towards American military intervention, in which the complexities and moral ambiguities of real warfare tend to be minimised or overlooked in favour of a binary black-and-white Manichaeism: the player goes in, kills all the bad guys and saves the day.</span><span class="c8">[5]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>&rsquo;s inciting incident is a massive sandstorm in the UAE which destroys much of Dubai, killing millions. John Konrad </span><span class="c8">[6]</span><span>, an American colonel stationed in Afghanistan, volunteers to lead his battalion (the so-called &ldquo;Damned 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&rdquo;) into Dubai to assist in rescue and evacuation orders, where they remain even after being ordered to withdraw by top military brass. Struggling to maintain law and order, the increasingly desperate 33</span><span class="c74">rd </span><span>imposes martial law on the city and commits atrocities as part of its efforts to keep the peace, while Konrad makes plans to lead a caravan of survivors out of the city. Owing to the extreme weather conditions, all communication with the Damned 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is lost, until six months later, the American military picks up a distress call, in which Konrad describes the attempted evacuation of the city as a &ldquo;complete failure&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The player controls Cpt. Martin Walker, a Delta Force operator who is sent into Dubai (along with two team members, Lt. Adams and Staff Sgt. Lugo) to investigate the distress beacon. Shortly after arriving, the Delta Force squad is ambushed by a group of Emirati insurgents, whom it engages in combat. Venturing further into the city in direct contravention of his orders, Walker learns that the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;battalion is seemingly being led by the &ldquo;Radioman&rdquo;, an embedded American journalist who barks orders at them via a citywide PA system; while the insurgents, for their part, are taking marching orders from a group of CIA agents, of whose presence Delta was thitherto unaware. Delta are mistaken for CIA agents by soldiers of the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>, and are forced to kill them in self-defense. Shortly afterwards, Delta stumbles across an abandoned hotel, in which soldiers of the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;are rounding up women and children. Surmising that they intend to massacre the civilians, Delta intervenes to stop the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">, but some of the soldiers manage to escape with over forty women and children in tow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Walker insists to his men that, even if the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;has apparently gone rogue, Col. Konrad himself must not be involved. As evidence of Konrad&rsquo;s honourable character, Walker cites his personal experience of serving under him in Afghanistan, during which time Konrad saved Walker&rsquo;s life. Believing that the CIA will be able to lead them to Konrad and thereby de-escalate the conflict, Delta battles its way through platoons of 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;soldiers in pursuit of an agent named Gould. Gould is killed by the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>, but Delta learns that his mission involved a building called the Gate. Making their way to the Gate, Delta finds its way impeded by an entire company of 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;soldiers, far too many to be defeated with small arms fire alone. Despite Lugo&rsquo;s protestations, Walker decides to deploy a white phosphorus mortar on the company, which inflicts horrific chemical burns on those afflicted by it. After defeating the company, Walker and his men make a gruesome discovery at the rear of the encampment: by using the mortar, they have accidentally killed the forty-seven Emirati women and children the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;led from the abandoned hotel, whom the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;had rounded up specifically to prevent them from getting caught in the crossfire. Inside the Gate, Walker finds the corpses of Col. Konrad&rsquo;s command team, whom Konrad had had executed; and a portable radio, through which Konrad speaks with him, taunting him for his na&iuml;vet&eacute; and errors in judgement. Walker infers that it has been Konrad who has been leading the rogue 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;all along, and that the Radioman is merely his lackey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Shortly thereafter, Delta rescues a CIA agent named Jeff Riggs from an assault by the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>. Riggs explains that his goal is to secure the trucks the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;use to distribute water to civilians in Dubai &ndash; if the CIA succeeds, they will cripple the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&rsquo;s control over the city. Walker and his squad assist him and succeed in commandeering the trucks, but almost immediately afterwards, Riggs intentionally crashes and destroys them. Trapped underneath one of the trucks, Riggs explains his reasoning to Walker: were the Arab nations ever to learn of the atrocities Konrad and the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;had committed as part of their efforts to maintain law and order in Dubai, they would wage war against the US in retribution. By destroying the trucks, Riggs has condemned the survivors to a slow death by dehydration, thereby preventing the truth about Dubai from getting out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Suffering from PTSD-induced hallucinations and growing increasingly aggressive, erratic and impulsive, Walker decides that his only hope is to evacuate Dubai of its few remaining survivors, a goal Konrad assures him is an impossibility. To that end, Delta locates the tower from which the Radioman is broadcasting. When the squad confronts an unarmed Radioman, Lugo abruptly shoots him dead, after which Walker broadcasts a message to the whole city through the PA system, in which he vows revenge on the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>. Commandeering a helicopter, Walker uses its mounted minigun to destroy the entire upper floor of the tower, including all of its PA equipment. Delta attempts to escape from the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;helicopters in pursuit, but their helicopter crashes in the desert and Walker is separated from Adams and Lugo. Walker locates Adams, but arrives too late to save Lugo from a lynch mob of furious Emiratis, whom the player has the option of massacring in retribution. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Walker decides the only goal worth pursuing is to kill Konrad, and leads Adams to the Burj al-Arab, which the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;is using as its headquarters. Slaughtering what few 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;soldiers remain, Walker abandons Adams and ascends to the tower&rsquo;s penthouse alone, whereupon he makes a horrendous discovery: Konrad had committed suicide days prior to Delta&rsquo;s arrival in Dubai. Since accidentally killing the civilians outside the Gate, the guilt has driven the already unstable Walker into a dissociative episode, and the Konrad taunting him over the radio was in fact a hallucination. The hallucinatory Konrad (Walker&rsquo;s own conscience, in effect) condemns Walker for having brought nothing but death and destruction to Dubai in his misguided pursuit of heroism, asserting that all of it could have been avoided had Walker simply followed his orders and not intervened in the conflict at all. Finally, Konrad presents the player with a choice: they can either shoot the hallucinatory Konrad (implicitly pinning the blame for the events of the game on him); or have Walker follow the real Konrad&rsquo;s example, and shoot himself in the head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The genesis of the game is an interesting one. </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was an existing shooter franchise in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which had lain dormant since its last entry in 2002. The publisher, 2K Games, was keen to revitalise the franchise, and hired Yager to develop a reboot, instructing them to modernise the franchise by taking pointers from the modern military shooter genre. Over the course of several years of development, the dev team gradually grew increasingly disgusted and disillusioned with themselves and their target demographic, unable to deny the cynicism inherent to creating a video game in which gunning down endless waves of human beings is presented as sanitised light entertainment. But rather than simply grinning and bearing it, they decided to incorporate these feelings of disgust and self-loathing into the game&rsquo;s design, presenting a narrative which would deconstruct the modern military genre, and challenge the players to consider why they play games like this in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Much as in </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>, </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&nbsp;presents a story in which disaster follows the protagonist&rsquo;s well-meaning but misguided decision to intervene in a situation he does not fully understand: a tragedy about the &ldquo;futility of good intentions&rdquo;. (At one point in his closing rant, the hallucinatory Konrad asserts to Walker that &ldquo;None of this would have happened if you&rsquo;d just </span><span class="c14">stopped</span><span>&rdquo;; he might as well have said: &ldquo;None of this would have happened if you&rsquo;d just done </span><span class="c14">as little as possible</span><span>&rdquo;.) As such, </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&nbsp;is just as much a paean to heroic inaction as </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;was &ndash; even more so, as Walker&rsquo;s actions result in </span><span class="c14">thousands</span><span>&nbsp;of deaths, many hundreds of them directly by his own hand. In a game featuring multiple endings (each bleaker than the one preceding it), the developers have explicitly stated that they consider the &ldquo;happiest&rdquo; ending the one in which the player elects to put down the controller and stop playing the game without seeing it through to the end. Much as </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;is a private investigator film in which investigation leads to tragedy, </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&nbsp;is a video game in which, to quote </span><span class="c14">WarGames</span><span>, &ldquo;the only winning move is not to play&rdquo;. (Once again, per Ozy, </span><span class="c14">not </span><span class="c3">playing a video game is something that even a corpse can do perfectly well, and it&rsquo;s no coincidence that two of the game&rsquo;s four endings depict Walker dying, one of them by his own hand.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As a self-reflexive (one might even say masturbatory) &ldquo;game about games&rdquo; in the vein of </span><span class="c14">Metal Gear Solid 2</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c14">BioShock</span><span>, </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is close to unimpeachable. It is inarguably true that the modern military shooter genre encodes various hidden assumptions into its game mechanics, assumptions which are all the more queasy and disquieting for going unexamined; that games about war habitually gloss over many of the complexities and difficult decisions inherent to real-life conflicts (like war crimes and civilian collateral damage); that even the combatants who survive real-life conflicts are often left horrifically scarred by their experiences, unlike the wisecracking, perpetually unfazed badasses which populate even the video games purporting to be realistic (at least as far as their graphics and physics engines go). These points are forcefully made and well-taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It&rsquo;s when the game moves away from analysing video games themselves and towards making critical arguments about real-world American military intervention that it veers onto much shakier ground.</span><span class="c8">[7]</span><span>&nbsp;Shortly after playing the game the year after its release, my initial thoughts about it were heavily inspired by Chris &ldquo;Campster&rdquo; Franklin&rsquo;s </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DwlBrenhzMZI&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170106768&amp;usg=AOvVaw1MHbF1KElKyJqpZ6KOxytt">video essay about it</a></span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span>As formal systems, computer games often have problems with ambiguity. Most games (not all, but most) have win states&hellip; The problem with win states is that they contextualise play in such a way that anything that pushes you towards the win state is good, while anything that pushes you away from this win state is bad. For example, from a ludic perspective, shooting the guys that are blocking your path forward in </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty</span><span>&nbsp;is an absolute good: it gets them out of the way so that you can safely traverse the map in order to reach the end, which is the level&rsquo;s win state. Without any other mechanic suggesting something to the contrary, or a narrative recontextualization of those mechanics, the game&rsquo;s rhetorical position is that shooting these men is an unequivocally good thing&hellip; By and large, game stories reflect the black-and-white nature of the gameplay, and assure you that you&rsquo;re on one side or the other of a binary morality &ndash; usually the good side. This sort of reductionist moral philosophy is OK for family-oriented games, like </span><span class="c14">Mario</span><span class="c3">&hellip; But it&rsquo;s extremely dangerous in the context of modern military shooters, because so much of the rest of the setting has a high level of fidelity to real-life. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">Pairing these gameplay and narrative aesthetics that reinforce a binary morality with the visual and audio imagery of real-world military actions promotes the idea that these actions are either objectively good or evil. It propagandises the glory of [the United States&rsquo;s] own military actions, while villainizing those of others. It argues against a more complete and complex understanding of events, where both parties involved may be in some way at fault. It boils complex political situations and historical conflicts down to &ldquo;which one were the good guys again?&rdquo; &hellip; Western powers being shown as an absolute good crushing the evil Arab or Russian or Asian enemies boils complicated geopolitics down to an oversimplified fairy tale that&#39;s disingenuous rah-rah nationalism at best, and destructive to meaningful discourse at worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>When it comes to moral complexity and ambiguity, the mere presence of characters with sincerely good intentions who take actions which backfire horribly places </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>&nbsp;head and shoulders above its brethren in the shooter genre, overwhelmingly populated as it is by one-dimensional lantern-jawed heroes and moustache-twirling villains. And yet for all that, it strikes me that many of Franklin&rsquo;s points about the deficiencies of the modern military shooter genre apply just as much to </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>, but in the opposite direction. While every action the protagonist in a conventional shooter takes brings him one step closer to saving the day, </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&nbsp;stacks the deck such that every single action Walker takes makes the situation even worse: at no point in the game does Walker ever do something intended to benefit another person, and actually succeed in improving their lot. As such, the game has effectively supplanted one set of contrivedly black-and-white game mechanics with another: a set of mechanics in which doing &ldquo;as little as possible&rdquo; (indeed, not playing at all) is the dominant strategy, </span><span class="c14">always</span><span>&nbsp;preferable to taking action of any kind. Suffice it to say that I believe such a mechanics set bears little more relationship to real life than the simplistic, sanitised heroism of </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and its ilk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And just as Franklin is troubled by video games which pair hyper-realistic imagery reminiscent of real-world political conflicts with game mechanics that admit of no ambiguity between heroes and villains &ndash; well, so too am I troubled by </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&rsquo;s own handling of the same set of tropes. If Franklin is concerned that gamers might play a </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty</span><span>&nbsp;game and arrive at the (presumably unintended but entirely foreseeable) conclusion that real-world politics are exactly as uncomplicated as the game implies, and that American military intervention overseas is always a force for good &ndash; </span><span class="c14">I</span><span>&nbsp;worry that someone might play </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>&nbsp;and arrive at the opposite conclusion: that American military intervention overseas is </span><span class="c14">always</span><span>&nbsp;a force for bad, that no good will </span><span class="c14">ever</span><span>&nbsp;come from it, that the world will </span><span class="c14">always</span><span>&nbsp;be better off if the US doesn&rsquo;t send troops in. Such a perspective, you&rsquo;ll note, is nigh-indistinguishable from the isolationism of Donald Trump, or indeed of Charles Lindbergh. It&rsquo;s not tilting at windmills to note there really </span><span class="c14">were</span><span>&nbsp;lots of Americans in the 1940s who sincerely thought the United States had no business getting involved in the Second World War: as late as April 1941, </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/great-debate&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170112002&amp;usg=AOvVaw2XKl3Q4UPyJ_WHol2fQIIw">a full third of the country</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;were opposed to the idea, and I&rsquo;m sure there were quite a few who still thought this even after the truth about the Holocaust had become public knowledge. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The question of what role the US should play in maintaining the rules-based international order is a complex and difficult one with no easy answers. </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty </span><span>and its ilk sidestep these complexities by forcefully asserting &ldquo;American military intervention good, next question&rdquo;, presenting sanitised, one-sided narratives in which the American military is heroic at best and temporarily ineffectual at worst. </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;sidesteps these complexities in the opposite direction by highlighting to an almost ghoulish degree all of the horrors that might result from such interventions, ignoring all positive outcomes that have historically resulted from them, and presenting even its legitimately well-meaning characters as misguided, stubborn, narcissistic and self-aggrandising. A monomaniacal fixation on the costs associated with taking action and a hyperbolic discounting of the concomitant benefits is, after all, the essence of slave morality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At one point in his closing rant, the hallucinatory Konrad scoffs at Walker, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here because you want to be something you&rsquo;re not: a hero&rdquo;. If this line is only intended as an observation about video games themselves, fair enough: who would dispute that experiencing a vicarious power fantasy is a major motivating factor in why gamers play shooters? But if this line is intended as a commentary on American military intervention overseas, then the hallucinatory Konrad seems to be suggesting that the very </span><span class="c14">idea</span><span>&nbsp;of an American soldier performing an act of heroism is just absurd on its face. Far be it from me to suggest that American military intervention abroad has always (or even </span><span class="c19 c14"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/11/book-review-manufacturing-consent/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170114031&amp;usg=AOvVaw240IU59cYGiqB2wNoEF9MO">primarily</a></span><span>) been a force for good: the examples of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and so on and so forth (and there is a </span><span class="c14">lot</span><span>&nbsp;of </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_interventions_by_the_United_States&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170114272&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Mo5MmBYPvziFAZFEQHWhA">so forth</a></span><span class="c3">) are well-trodden territory among the anti-interventionist set, examples I have no desire to defend. But hot take incoming: I do, in fact, believe that the American soldiers who helped liberate Europe from the Nazis were heroic. The fact that, in the course of doing so, these soldiers accidentally killed civilians and committed other acts which we would retrospectively (or even contemporaneously) consider violations of the Geneva Conventions does nothing to fundamentally alter this opinion. The counterfactual world in which they did not do so would be poorer than ours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Williams and Pearsey might defend themselves by arguing that they </span><span class="c14">only</span><span>&nbsp;intended </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&nbsp;as a meta-commentary on shooter games, and gamers who interpret it as an argument in favour of American isolationism and non-intervention are reading arguments into it that they never personally intended. But of course, I&rsquo;m sure the writers of the </span><span class="c14">Call of Duty</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c14">Battlefield</span><span>&nbsp;games would deploy exactly the same argument: that they only ever intended </span><span class="c14">their</span><span>&nbsp;games as light entertainment, and that they hence bear no responsibility if their audiences interpret them as serious geopolitical commentary, or as accurate portrayals of contemporary real-world conflicts. The whole crux of </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops</span><span>&rsquo;s critique of modern military shooters rests on the idea that their creators&rsquo; stated authorial intent is irrelevant: that they bear responsibility for </span><span class="c14">all</span><span>&nbsp;the messages their games convey, explicit or otherwise.

I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say that, in a list of the most impenetrable books I&rsquo;ve ever read, it would easily make the top ten: occasional glimmers of legible insight and wisdom, buried within mountains of contemptuous stream-of-consciousness ranting about Greek tragedy, children&rsquo;s books, imaginary porn films and forgettable nineties thrillers.

This was one of many points I didn&rsquo;t really understand while reading the book, but writing this essay has me groping towards a possible interpretation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Both </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>&nbsp;have been interpreted as parables about the dangers of acting with insufficient information. Jake Gittes is sincerely well-intended, but makes several bad decisions on the basis of erroneous assumptions </span><span class="c14">e.g.</span><span>&nbsp;believing the impostor who claims to be Evelyn Mulwray and agreeing to spy on Hollis on that basis; inferring that Evelyn murdered Hollis and hence providing the police with her location. Likewise Cpt. Walker, who mistakenly assumes that the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;are rounding up civilians from the hotel for purposes of massacring rather than protecting them; who carelessly deploys the white phosphorus mortar without properly scouting the field of fire for a civilian presence; and who never stops to really consider </span><span class="c14">why</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Riggs is so intent on gaining control of the water trucks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act until you have enough information to make an informed decision&rdquo; sounds sensible on its face. But in reality, it&rsquo;s a meaningless aphorism, no different to the admonishment to &ldquo;never assume&rdquo;: how much information is &ldquo;enough&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s something that can only really be determined in retrospect: you&rsquo;ll know your decision was an &ldquo;informed&rdquo; one only </span><span class="c14">after</span><span>&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve made it and it hasn&rsquo;t hideously backfired because of something you weren&rsquo;t aware of at the time you made it. We are </span><span class="c14">always</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;acting from a place of ignorance and incomplete information &ndash; the difference is only a matter of degree, and perfect, absolute knowledge of a given situation is both a practical and literal impossibility. Ergo, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t act until I had enough information&rdquo; is an admonishment for passivity and inaction dressed up in the language of hard-headed commonsense. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This, I think, may have been what Teach was getting at when he talked about the antithetical relationship between knowledge and power: while &ldquo;don&rsquo;t act until you have enough information to make an informed decision&rdquo; might sound sensible on its face, it&rsquo;s an absolute godsend to those inclined towards inaction. While these people are constitutionally inclined to do &ldquo;as little as possible&rdquo;, they will always insist that the reason they have failed to act isn&rsquo;t that they are </span><span class="c14">globally</span><span>&nbsp;passive, but simply </span><span class="c14">contingently</span><span>&nbsp;passive up until the point at which they&rsquo;ve gathered &ldquo;enough information&rdquo; with which to make an informed decision. But because &ldquo;enough&rdquo; is underdetermined, you can go on gathering information forever, and still feel like you don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;enough&rdquo;. In the Teachian perspective, as mentioned earlier, ostentatious self-loathing isn&rsquo;t a starting point towards positive change, but rather a </span><span class="c14">defense against</span><span>&nbsp;positive change. By the same token, collecting information isn&rsquo;t something done in order to make informed decisions, but something done as a </span><span class="c14">defense against</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;having to make decisions of any kind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Looking at the stories of </span><span class="c14">Chinatown</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c14">Spec Ops: The Line</span><span>&nbsp;from a zoomed-out perspective, it&rsquo;s easy for us to conclude that its protagonists were acting in ignorance, and that in hindsight things would have turned out better had they not gotten involved. But in real life, we are never acting with foreknowledge: we are only </span><span class="c14">ever</span><span>&nbsp;acting from a place of comparative ignorance. Viewed in this light, our two protagonists actually come off rather better than their creators would have us believe. Gittes&rsquo;s inference that Evelyn had drowned her husband in a jealous rage (and hence that he should turn her in to the police, lest he be arrested as an accessory after the fact) was erroneous, but a reasonable conclusion </span><span class="c14">given the information available to him at the time</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; and Evelyn herself bears no small amount of responsibility for actively misleading him. If Gittes had been correct, doing nothing and allowing a murderer to escape scot-free would have been the wrong decision. Likewise, Walker&rsquo;s conclusion that the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;were rounding up civilians from the abandoned hotel in order to massacre them was incorrect, but reasonable given the information known to him at the time: if he&rsquo;d been right, doing nothing and allowing the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;to murder a group of women and children in cold blood would have been the wrong decision. In retrospect, he ought to have thoroughly scouted the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span>&nbsp;encampment before giving the order to fire the white phosphorus mortar &ndash; but given that, only a few minutes earlier, he&rsquo;d personally witnessed soldiers of the 33</span><span class="c74">rd </span><span>torturing and executing civilians in hopes of extracting information from Gould, it was hardly unreasonable of him to assume the 33</span><span class="c74">rd</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;did not have the best interests of the Dubai civilians at heart.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.tl3kc6pebegr"><span class="c25 c39">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Refusing to intervene may </span><span class="c14">feel</span><span>&nbsp;like passivity, but it is not.

Even if many of these migrants had made it big as merchants, they still suffered discrimination coming from the traditional &lsquo;oligarchy&rsquo; due to their ethnic origin. The Bukele family was singularly hit by this discrimination because they, unlike other Christian or Jewish Palestinians, were actually </span><span class="c14">muslim</span><span class="c3">. As a result, the Bukele were special amongst the millionaires for their sympathy to the left-wing party, the FMLN.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Bukele himself studied law at a prestigious, left-leaning university, before dropping out to run the private business of his family - which included a nightclub. Eventually, he found his calling in marketing, which led him to run several campaigns of the FMLN.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">In his thirties, he had enough of running campaigns for other people, and decided to run under the FMLN flag as mayor of a small town. He, like Erdogan and Modi, &lsquo;did good jobs as administrators, plus had the PR skills to make it look like they did an even better job than they did&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">He successfully marketed himself as the herald of a renewed, rejuvenated El Salvador:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_gjqybj6pi51u-0 start"><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span>The name of the town, </span><span class="c14">Nuevo Cuscatl&aacute;n</span><span class="c3">, means &lsquo;New El Salvador&rsquo;. [11]</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span>Instead of using the colors of his party, he adopted a bright cyan, which </span><span class="c14">if you squint</span><span>&nbsp;kind of looks like a more energetic, </span><span class="c14">youthful</span><span class="c3">, version of the national colors: Blue and white.</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The logo of the town, a bright &lsquo;N&rsquo; inside a circle, could be interpreted either as being the initial of his first name, &lsquo;Nayib&rsquo;; or the initial of what was then his movement &lsquo;Nuevas Ideas&rsquo;.</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span>On the one hand, he tried to appeal to moderate voters by promoting the need for national unity across the political spectrum to face the challenges that the country was facing. After all, even if was a left-winger, his family were </span><span class="c14">millionaires</span><span>, so many people doubted that he would implement &lsquo;21st century socialism&rsquo;. He &nbsp;also marketed himself to the predominantly Christian population by portraying himself as a bearded, </span><span class="c14">Christian </span><span class="c3">30-year-old, whose family literally came from Bethlehem.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>On the other hand, he also retained the support of his base by proclaiming that he was a left-winger at heart, praising Marx, Chavez, and Castro. And also by picking up fights against the right-wing newspaper, </span><span class="c14">La Prensa Gr&aacute;fica</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Much like India&rsquo;s Modi, the attacks of the right-wing media on him were &lsquo;so vicious and baseless that they made ordinary Salvadorans, who didn&rsquo;t like or trust them, think he was on their side&rsquo;. Bukele incentivized that animosity by attacking the right-wing newspapers for not paying taxes [12].</span></p><p class="c15"><span>But most importantly, he </span><span class="c14">actually governed well</span><span class="c3">: His small town truly did have low crime, and like India&rsquo;s Modi, he had &lsquo;a reputation as the least corrupt person in the Salvadoran government&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>From my viewpoint, his big break came from what I call </span><span class="c14">trashgate: </span><span>In 2014, the garbage collectors in </span><span class="c14">Mejicanos</span><span>&nbsp;(another locality inside the metropolitan area) were on strike against the right-wing mayor, leading to trash accumulating on the streets. Bukele went ahead and, alongside another mayor, </span><span class="c14">literally cleaned up the streets</span><span class="c3">. This established his reputation as a young politician who rejected outdated rules in favor of &lsquo;Getting Shit Done&rsquo;. [13]</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">His meteoric rise continued by getting elected as mayor of the capital, just three years after having started his political career. There, he undertook the seemingly titanic task of revitalizing the historic downtown, which had become synonymous with crime, dirt, and poverty.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>He managed to &lsquo;clean up&rsquo; a lot of the downtown </span><span class="c14">without</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;violence, partly by creating a new market where he relocated several of the street sellers, and partly by just breaking historic conservation laws that his own party had passed. This solidified his reputation as the institution-smasher who could &lsquo;Get Shit Done&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c15"><span>In hindsight, we now know that by this period, Bukele&rsquo;s people were </span><span class="c14">negotiating</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with the gangs: Carlos Marroquin, a city official, would provide the gangs with favorable spots on the new market meant for street sellers, in exchange for the gangs diminishing murders downtown. As a result, the gangs were very favorable towards Bukele, even if they grew more hostile against what was then his party, the left-wing FMLN.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>What was Bukele &#39;s alias in these </span><span class="c14">illegal</span><span>&nbsp;negotiations? </span><span class="c14">Batman</span><span class="c3">.

Eventually it became obvious that the left-wing party wouldn&rsquo;t give him the nomination for the next presidential election. He intensified his criticism, which eventually led to him being expelled.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">In late 2017 it was far from obvious whether Bukele could win with a third party, even if he was the most popular politician:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_i0ame2ejkkcp-0 start"><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">First, he started organizing his own party, but he couldn&rsquo;t register it by the deadline.</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span>Then, in 2018, he attempted to use the center-left </span><span class="c14">Cambio Democr&aacute;tico</span><span>&nbsp;party, only to have the Supreme Court </span><span class="c14">cancel this party</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;due to their low vote share in the past election. This was a shameless power-grab by the Supreme Court.</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">At the last possible minute</span><span>, he joined the center-right </span><span class="c14">GANA</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;party. This was a party which, unlike the 2018 Bukele, had always defended socially conservative and tough-on-crime measures, even while being one of the most notoriously corrupt parties itself. The American embassy had described it as &lsquo;a party for sale&rsquo;.</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span>If GANA was a party for sale, Bukele had the money, and he bought them: He successfully rebranded the party, changing its colors to a darkened version of the Bukelist </span><span class="c14">cyan</span><span class="c3">. Yet, at least one of my left-wing friends decided not to vote for Bukele because of this switch.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>In the end, the attempts by the Supreme Court to block him may feel justified</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;in hindsight</span><span>, but they actually backfired, by making him even more popular. Forcing him to join the right-wing </span><span class="c14">GANA</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;party might have been beneficial too, as this party had a presence in the rural areas, where Bukele was weaker.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span>Near the midnight of February 3rd, 2019, Bukele surprised the entire country by winning the 2019 presidency with a landslide 53.1% of the vote. My entire family and myself weren&rsquo;t surprised that he won, we were surprised that won </span><span class="c14">in the first round</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">It was the end of an era, and the dawn of a new day.</span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.y9v4tbiyngvx"><span>IV. </span><span class="c8">THE DICTATORIAL POWER-GRAB.</span></h2><p class="c15"><span>The new President seeked to staff the entire executive branch of the government with loyalists </span><span class="c14">who actually knew how to govern</span><span class="c3">. This was seemingly something hard to do, given that he had alienated both formerly major parties.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">So, what did mr. President do?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">He ended up relying on former friends and associates. Much like in Hungary, &lsquo;the rank order of how rich and powerful you are in today&rsquo;s El Salvador, and the rank order of how close you sat to Bukele in the cafeteria of his elite high school, are more similar than anyone has a right to expect.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Bukele moved on to shamelessly run the government-owned TV Station and radio channel as propaganda. More importantly, he created a new Government newspaper, &lsquo;Diario El Salvador&rsquo;. In theory, this newspaper was meant to be run &lsquo;as a private enterprise&rsquo;, creating a profit and paying taxes. In reality, by selling it at $0.25, it seemed like the actual purpose was to undercut all competing newspapers. In El Salvador some of the media -but not all- saw &lsquo;which way the winds were blowing&rsquo; and voluntarily self-censored.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Next: The police and military. Recruitment was increased with the objective of doubling the size of the military over the next 5-year period. The police officers over 60-years-of-age were forced to retire. For those who remained, Bukele doubled their salary.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">The last part, coupled with the fact that the already-diminishing murder rate continued to plummet from the very day he took office, meant that Bukele had earned the enduring loyalty of the entire State repressive apparatus.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>In hindsight, we see that he </span><span class="c14">also had the loyalty of the gangs</span><span class="c3">, who saw in Bukele a more constructive way out of the asymmetrical warfare that had been the norm during the previous administration. Now, I believe that the goal of the gangs during this 2019 - 2022 period was to evolve into a more &lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; and less self-destructive criminal organization; while the goal of the government was to bite their time until they could effectively destroy them.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">At the same time, Bukele&rsquo;s public rhetoric morphed to one of complete warfare against the gangs: He closed off all communication between the jails and the outer world. He &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; the members of different gangs. He destroyed the graffiti and defaced the tombs of gang members. He praised the police and army as &lsquo;heroes&rsquo;, while decrying Human Rights defenders as &lsquo;defenders of criminals&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Then came the turning point. On February 9, 2020, Bukele summoned Congress to discuss a security loan. When opposition deputies refused to show up, he entered Congress with armed soldiers on live TV. He prayed, sat in the president&rsquo;s chair, and hinted at dissolving the Legislative branch. In the end, he decided to wait for the next elections, to defeat the opposition in the ballot boxes.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>That day, I retweeted a quote from the opposition, decrying what had happened as an attempted </span><span class="c14">autogolpe. </span><span class="c3">In the following weeks, I learned that the public largely supported it: &nbsp;It proved to them that Bukele wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;just another politician&rsquo;, and that congressmen were &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; people who wouldn&rsquo;t work on weekends.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">When Covid came, El Salvador swiftly became one of the most hawkish pro-lockdown governments, going as far as ignoring Supreme Court rulings against the lockdown, affirming that to obey them would be like &lsquo;murdering Salvadorans&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>The following year, Bukele&rsquo;s &lsquo;New Ideas&rsquo; Party won the 2021 legislative elections with a landslide 66.5% of the popular vote. The Bukelist vote share actually </span><span class="c14">increased</span><span>&nbsp;from the 2019 election </span><span class="c14">on every single &lsquo;departamento&rsquo;</span><span class="c3">. This was enough for his party to achieve a &#8532; &lsquo;supermajority&rsquo; in congress, and not have to rely on the opposition for governance.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">The new legislature&rsquo;s first move: remove Supreme Court justices, replacing them with loyalists. Checks and balances were gone overnight.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>I went back to my retweet that was critical of Bukele&rsquo;s </span><span class="c14">autogolpe</span><span class="c3">, and promptly deleted it. I haven&rsquo;t posted publicly about politics ever since.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Alexander Scott argues that &lsquo;all dictators get their start by discovering some loophole in the democratic process.&rsquo; What Bukele found was that he could just win all the votes and acquire all the power.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>Other dictators, like Erdogan, had to find innovative ways in which to &lsquo;hack the checks-and-balances system requiring 2/3 majorities&rsquo;. Bukele found the best hack of all: To just actually win, at least </span><span class="c8">once</span><span class="c3">. That was all he needed to gerrymander his way into earning supermajorities, seemingly forever:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_1cezgcgck1j9-0 start"><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">In the 2019 election, Bukele earned 53.1% of the vote.

This had great success in increasing tourism, but less so in actually establishing a Bitcoin economy.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">He eventually got distracted by the whole &lsquo;war-on-gangs&rsquo; thing, but when that issue was solved, that gave rise to a real-estate boom. Yet the rest of the economy lagged far behind.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">This meant that actual Salvadorans were facing both increasingly unaffordable housing as well as the post-Covid 19 inflation, with only meager increases in our incomes.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">So, just like Erdogan did in the 2000s, Bukele asked himself &lsquo;what would a real center-right President do?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span>Even if Bukele hasn&#39;t spent the past five years mangling the Constitution to make it impossible to ever </span><span class="c14">not</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;elect him, he probably still would have won elections in a landslide.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">The moment where I knew that for sure was in 2022, when he went on national TV to denounce merchants for high food prices, threatening to &lsquo;jail any merchant who charges above a certain amount&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>At that time, I was </span><span class="c14">offended</span><span>, yet several of my family members were </span><span class="c14">relieved</span><span>&nbsp;to see their suspicions that the merchants were &lsquo;overcharging&rsquo; were seemingly justified. Later on, Bukele went on to </span><span class="c14">not jail anyone</span><span class="c3">, instead choosing to implement a government-subsidized farmer&rsquo;s market.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">This is the political genius of Bukele: To adopt a populist rhetoric like Chavez, but then going and adopting moderate, technocratic policies. &nbsp;This approach has the triple benefit of:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_gdufita0qu2s-0 start" start="1"><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Increasing Bukele&rsquo;s approval rating.</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Baiting the opposition into defending unpopular postures.</span></li><li class="c15 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Effectively avoiding the flaw of democracy in which candidates can &lsquo;temporarily increase their popularity by doing things which are popular even though they&rsquo;re bad ideas&rsquo;.</span></li></ol><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Maybe this is because, unlike Chavez, Bukele doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;enough oil money to defy gravity for a very long time&rsquo; [15].</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">After winning the 2024 re-election in a landslide, he proclaimed that his next challenge was to jumpstart the economy. To do this, he has recently been approved on a long-negotiated IMF loan that will hopefully see the Government reach fiscal sustainability without sacrificing long-term investing in infrastructure.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Ironically, as Bukele adopted more moderate, center-right positions, he became more well known abroad as a far-right leader.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">And, just like Orb&aacute;n, &lsquo;it also catapulted him to fame in the wider world. Rightists across the continent began hailing him as the savior of Latin America, the man who stopped crime when no one else could. Now, Bukele started having grander plans, plans of becoming a beloved model for the world.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">So, is Bukele going the way of Singapore&rsquo;s Lee Kuan Yew, or of Turkey&rsquo;s Erdogan? </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Only time will tell. My intuition tells me that the difference between LKY and Erdogan will come down to whether Bukele succeeds at creating an &lsquo;economic miracle&rsquo;, or not.</span></p><p class="c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 390.28px; height: 259.90px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.png" style="width: 390.28px; height: 259.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span><br></span><span class="c77 c14">Pictured: San Salvador, a city under construction.<br>Source: </span><span class="c19 c77 c14"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://republicainmobiliaria.com/editorial/el-salvador-inversiones-us1200-millones/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170181411&amp;usg=AOvVaw3fXF3yGHqfGiyuJvRRtxHE">https://republicainmobiliaria.com/editorial/el-salvador-inversiones-us1200-millones/</a></span><span class="c33 c58 c77 c14">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.2yeg5w9o8elf"><span>VI. </span><span class="c8">COULD IT HAPPEN IN AMERICA?</span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Absolutely</span></p><h3 class="c79 c85" id="h.8906j1ljerob"><span class="c34">First, our aspiring dictator needs to &lsquo;Get Shit Done&rsquo;.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span>Which means he (or she) needs to get power in a small region and </span><span class="c8">prove</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that you can solve a problem that no one else at the national level has been able to solve. This could mean going to Detroit and solving crime. Or it could mean going to San Francisco and solving homelessness, as the current mayor seems to be doing. Or going to the midwest and solving the opioid crisis.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>The most important thing is to do this </span><span class="c8">in a non-authoritarian, compassionate way</span><span class="c3">, because that would give permission to all Americans to support this man.</span></p><h3 class="c85 c79" id="h.toyni62dn563"><span class="c34">Second, the dictator needs to position himself as a moderate.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Remember that the dictator wants to take over &#8532; of the votes in order to change the laws. It&rsquo;s not enough to do as Trump did and take complete control of one party, because there are some people who would never vote for that party.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">I believe that in a system so resilient as America, what separates an aspiring dictator from a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; President is that the dictator needs to create his own third-party that he controls completely, which is actually capable of contesting the national elections.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">You might think that it&rsquo;s impossible for a third party to win nationally in America. So did Bukele. By the time that he came into the political scene, the bases of both major political parties had become fed-up with the establishment.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Getting expelled instead of resigning was key: In the 2019 election people saw him as an outsider and a fighter against the establishment, despite the fact that by then, he had been in politics for almost a decade.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s not enough to just &lsquo;stand there and be worthy of absolute power&rsquo;, as Curtis Yarvin would argue. You also need to actively harness the forces that want to give you power.</span></p><h3 class="c85 c79" id="h.bqcs81jh5ofl"><span class="c34">Third, our aspiring dictator needs to harness the power of the Presidency to acquire absolute power.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span>The key pillar of Bukele&rsquo;s power was basically &lsquo;bribing&rsquo; the military and police by literally doubling their salary, which used to be close to the minimum wage. But it wasn&rsquo;t just about the money: Bukele made the police and military feel </span><span class="c8">proud</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of themselves. He publicly called them &lsquo;heroes&rsquo;, and attributed to them the decline in homicides.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">In comparison, the US Armed Forces seem to be already well-paid, and to have a lot of respect for America&#39;s 200-year old Constitution. Also, El Salvador is a 6 million people country with one national police force. America is a 300+ million people country with a different police force in each major city, so it would be even more difficult to capture their loyalty.</span></p><h3 class="c85 c79" id="h.rb8qgkptdbey"><span class="c34">Fourth, our dictator&rsquo;s new political party needs to win supermajorities in Congress, and immediately use that power to pack the Court.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span>In El Salvador, the Supreme Court was indeed worried that Bukele would try to impeach them, but they never expected it to be </span><span class="c8">literally the first thing that the New Ideas Congress did</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">When it finally happened, the Salvadoran Supreme Court already had a draft ruling making their own impeachment illegal, but they struggled to communicate it because the Government had already taken control of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s website, social media, and even their building.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">In the subsequent days, the Government intensified the pressure on the Supreme Court Judges to resign, by doing things like having the cops show up at their home and giving them barely veiled threats against their ill family members. Eventually, they all resigned.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>This was a </span><span class="c14">blitzkrieg</span><span>&nbsp;that surprised the old Supreme Court, and it was only made possible by its speed. Similarly, the 2022 crackdown on gangs was also a stab-in-the-back </span><span class="c14">of the gangs</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">The only thing that might make this difficult in America is the fact that no single election can deliver a majority in the Senate. However, the capitulation of the GOP Senators to MAGA is unsettling.</span></p><h3 class="c85 c79" id="h.8oc885o2x144"><span class="c34">Fifth, this aspiring dictator needs to prove that he can &lsquo;Get Shit Done&rsquo; on the national level, too.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span>Many readers of the Dictator Book Club are familiarized with the idea that dictators basically &lsquo;hack&rsquo; the laws in order to make it impossible for their own party to win. However, what isn&rsquo;t obvious is that this would be accompanied by massive protests and repression, </span><span class="c33 c44 c14">unless the dictator is proving that he can &lsquo;Get Shit Done&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">There will always be some people who are willing to protest against dictators, even if it&rsquo;s risky. But this is less likely if the new regime is perceived as objectively better than the old, because then, the &lsquo;revolutionary freedom-fighters&rsquo; will be perceived as &lsquo;reactionaries &rsquo;protesting in favor of the &lsquo;old&rsquo; establishment.</span></p><h3 class="c85 c79" id="h.e1x41ep9skij"><span class="c34">Finally, the aspiring dictator can never let his guard down.</span></h3><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Being dictator is a curse, not only for your nation, but for yourself as well.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">During all of this essay, I&rsquo;ve been referring to Bukele through his self-styled &lsquo;World&rsquo;s Coolest Dictator&rsquo; moniker. But, much like Hugo Chavez, it isn&rsquo;t clear how much of an actual dictator he is.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Personally, I refer to Bukele as &lsquo;Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Dictator&rsquo;: If he loses elections, is he ever going to pull-off a Maduro and turn the State machinery used for the war on gangs against his own citizenship? We might never know, because he could just always win all elections for real.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>I&rsquo;m not going to deny that Bukele has already used lawfare against his political enemies, such as </span><span class="c14">&lsquo;Neto&rsquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Muyshondt. However, there still remains a fig leaf of &lsquo;due process&rsquo;. After all, Neto was obviously a corrupt politician, who is literally on-tape negotiating cash-for-votes with the gangs.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Contrast that to what El Salvador experienced before and during the Salvadoran Civil War: The military literally shooting protestors on-sight, opposition activists executed by death squads. Nothing of that sort has happened. Yet.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">If this all looks like a very tiring job, it&rsquo;s because it is: Bukele recently published that he only sleeps &lsquo;two hours&rsquo; a day.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">Maybe what separates a dictator from a leader is their laziness. It must be easier to just suspend all elections, as in China, and just focus on governing; instead of actually competing.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>Luckily, Bukele is young: He seems to </span><span class="c14">enjoy</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the thrill of fighting, as long as he always keeps an ace up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.ukarmlux58bc"><span>VI. </span><span class="c8">A VISION FOR THE FUTURE.</span></h2><p class="c15"><span>So, should you be more </span><span class="c14">Bukele-skeptic</span><span>, or more </span><span class="c14">Bukele-pilled</span><span class="c3">?</span></p><p class="c15"><span>Neither. Instead, you should become more </span><span class="c14">Bukele-curious</span><span class="c3">, as I have over the last 3 years [16].</span></p><p class="c15"><span>I believe that my nation is currently at an inflection point: Bukele could either become more like Singapore&rsquo;s Lee Kuan Yew, or more like Turkey&rsquo;s Erdogan; and I will become more or less </span><span class="c14">Bukele-pilled</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;depending on which direction he takes.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>If you want to know how I plan to measure this, and to forecast the future of Salvadoran democracy, then </span><span class="c8">you should help me win the contest</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;so that I can pitch Scott on future posts.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>After all, if Bukele proves to be more like Erdogan, then I&rsquo;ll be taking a real material risk </span><span class="c14">just by writing this review</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;which acknowledges the gang truce as real. That&rsquo;s a risk that I&rsquo;m not willing to take without the protective mantle of pseudonymity.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">***</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">History hasn&rsquo;t ended yet.

But there&rsquo;s more than a shred of irony in having a monument to liberty in the middle of a rocky island, accessible only by one state-sanctioned ferry, only to those with advance reservations. It&rsquo;s as if liberty herself is bound to a sort of Alcatraz. This monument is a gift from the elites of one nation to the elites of another. This statue of freedom isn&rsquo;t free in any sense.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good thing, then, that America has hundreds of true monuments to liberty. They are scattered all across its breadth. They exist in every state, in cities and in unknown expanses, in rich areas and poor areas alike. These are the roadside attractions that fill up empty bands of highway everywhere in the country. There is hardly anything more American than the roadside attraction: hardly any other country has a population affluent enough, territory vast enough, and highway infrastructure robust enough, to sustain a road trip industry. Most importantly, no other country has enough crazies to fill the fields with weird junk.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the uninitiated, roadside attractions are odd little diversions private citizens set up on their land, usually in the middle of nowhere, to give travelers something to do amid the monotony of driving through America&rsquo;s interstates. Among these are such venerable icons as the world&rsquo;s largest ball of twine (Cawker City, Kansas), the world&rsquo;s largest bobblehead (Belville, Ohio), the world&rsquo;s largest ball of paint (Alexandra, Indiana), and even wonders that are wonderful for reasons other than their largeness, like the May Natural History Museum (Rock Creek Park, Colorado)<br></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my home state of Colorado, there&rsquo;s one roadside attraction that stands above the rest in fame. It&rsquo;s a place of pilgrimage for many residents; an important gem in Colorado&rsquo;s snow-capped crown of mountain diversions. The creator just passed away last year. Throughout his life, from youth to death, he built the largest one-man castle in the world. This is Bishop&rsquo;s Castle.<br></span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.391dde1s6k4i"><span class="c25 c39">I: The Highest Point in Custer County</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 278.50px; height: 300.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image54.jpg" style="width: 400.42px; height: 300.26px; margin-left: -65.45px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h2><p class="c15"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c77 c88 c14 c151">Freedom</span><span class="c33 c77 c89 c151 c88">. It&#39;s a word that gets mentioned a lot when talking about Bishop Castle, an attraction that has already outlasted several previous attempts to explain it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span>-- </span><span class="c33 c44 c14">Roadside America</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many roadside attractions are strategically placed between towns, Bishop&rsquo;s Castle is out of the way. Thirty miles and over a strip of mountains from Pueblo, it lays along a road of no importance between nowhere and nothing in particular. The castle isn&rsquo;t a brief distraction on your way to something else. It is a deliberate choice.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As your car climbs the Wet Mountains, surrounded by dense forest on both sides, the temptation to turn around and seek the castle in one of the many side roads pulls at you. Despite the fort&rsquo;s great height, the trees hide it until you&rsquo;re only a few feet away. For this reason, the castle doesn&rsquo;t loom in the distance and steadily crawl closer. It leaps out of the trees like a pouncing bobcat.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first impression of the castle reveals its lack of military value. This is an architectural fancy-- its primary purpose is to exist. This is a Neuchwenstein, not a Krak des Chevaliers. The castle&rsquo;s design looks like something out of a Roald Dahl novel-- twisty metal paths swing around the exterior. A long stone staircase reaches out like a spider&rsquo;s leg to move visitors to the great hall. Meanwhile, the castle itself seems to peer out at visitors through a shining dragon&rsquo;s head. In the back, the second-largest tower tops out with an incomplete geodesic dome and a staircase to nowhere.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing you&rsquo;ll notice when you look at the castle is its material. There are no gray cut stones to be found here. Every wall is made of irregular orange cobbles from the mountains stuck together. The castle blends into its surroundings because it&rsquo;s made of them-- its orange hue matches that of the mountains that shelter it.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 383.50px; height: 288.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image118.jpg" style="width: 383.50px; height: 288.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from its remoteness, Bishop&rsquo;s Castle is set apart from other local attractions by its lack of an entry fee. There isn&rsquo;t even a fence surrounding the structure. The visitor gets the impression that the castle isn&rsquo;t a commercial enterprise, but rather a part of the landscape, like just another rocky crag. However, a closer approach bursts that fantasy and reveals a few signs of human occupation. The entry gate is flanked by signs:</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK,&rdquo; one sign reads, &ldquo;WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY! BISHOP CASTLE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION! WE RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION! YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE STRONGLY EXPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how most people first learn about the forceful personality of the castle builder. More on him later.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 344.21px; height: 257.83px;"><img alt="" src="images/image35.jpg" style="width: 344.21px; height: 257.83px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the signs, there are very few symbols of regulation in the place. You don&rsquo;t see the owners. There are no waivers to sign, no liabilities, no handrails, and no guides. You are left alone with the castle and your wits. This is what gives the castle such excitement.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big mark of the castle is impressive metalworking, and visitors first see this at the gatehouse. There&rsquo;s a beautiful (if probably immobile) portcullis with gears, chains, and wheels. The gatehouse itself has a room inside it, accessible via a tiny stone staircase. It looks like a quarter-finished foyer.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you go into the castle itself you can first explore the bottom floor, which is a dungeon-like series of caverns divided by rocky posts that hold up the entire castle. Climbing up one of the spiral staircases will bring you to the great hall, which is the largest room of the castle and its body. This is also well decorated. The floor is surprisingly clean and bright, and the iron works with the rock even better here to deliver a beautiful effect. Everything is bathed in multicolor light from the stained glass that forms the siding of one of the walls of the great hall.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 463.51px; height: 347.63px;"><img alt="" src="images/image55.jpg" style="width: 463.51px; height: 347.63px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might also see in the great hall other visitors peeking at you from atop ledges on either side. These are accessible from stairs. The lack of rails on these ledges once again reveals part of the philosophy of the builder, which is heavy on pomp and light on safety.</span><span class="c33 c44 c14"><br></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did all this come to be? It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to tell if you only visited the castle itself, since they don&rsquo;t make you watch a thirty-minute history video or anything. The seeker of the castle&rsquo;s history must do a little bit of investigation. They will find a fascinating tale, a tale well representative of midcentury America, a tale of genius and madness. It is impossible to understand the castle without understanding the story of the castle builder.</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c3"><br></span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.mo4hdl7ba3bt"><span class="c25 c39">II: The Castle Builder</span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This will be a free Disneyland.

This became an annual camping spot for the Bishop family. As he grew up, Bishop began to earn a living by working in the ironworking trade with his father and installing patios. By 1969, he had started using the money he earned to build a cabin, then a water cistern that he surrounded with rocks from the nearby area. These rocks would come to haunt him later.<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 314.50px; height: 219.65px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 314.50px; height: 219.65px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the story goes, the cobblestone cottage and the rocky turret surrounding the cistern resembled a castle, family members, friends, and local ranchers kept asking Bishop if he was building one. He denied it at first, but apparently this question came with such frequency that it planted an idea in his brain. One day, his answer switched to &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; He would give the public their castle. He chose not to stop when he finished the cabin. He kept building&hellip; and building&hellip; and building.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rocky roadside edifice grew, it became a local attraction. For eight years, people offered to help with the castle. Bishop got frustrated when no one made good on their offers, though, and this led him to declare his castle a one-man project.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop had been frustrated as a kid when he wasn&rsquo;t able to go to attractions and amusement parks because his family couldn&rsquo;t afford the ticket. To keep the castle accessible, he charged no entrance fee and financed the project on a shoestring budget. He stacked rock over rock, hoisting them each up one after the other with a pully system powered by his truck&rsquo;s engine. His forging skills helped him decorate and support every stone with wrought iron.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 332.16px; height: 337.12px;"><img alt="" src="images/image117.png" style="width: 332.16px; height: 337.12px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite no architectural experience or plans, Bishop&rsquo;s sheer industry kept the castle growing and stable. When he built a wall that needed to be eight feet thick, Jim made it 16. He hauled every rock, fell every log and milled it into lumber, built scaffolding for every tower, built every arch out of railroad ties. He designed complex pulley systems to hoist lumber for use as floorboards. He burrowed holes dozens of feet into the ground, then filled these with mortar he mixed and carried to the site himself. The castle is anchored deep in mountain bedrock, better rooted than the trees. Stone by stone, he built his dreams.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Jim&rsquo;s industriousness was added a flair for publicity. For decades, he fought to keep the castle in the public eye. Among the best victories in this campaign was the construction of the dragon figurehead. To build this. Bishop riveted thousands of steel warming plates around a steel frame to make the dragon&rsquo;s scales. The figurehead is rigged to belch fire from a recycled hot-air balloon burner. Today, the beast hovers eighty feet high, perched on the front of the grand ballroom, looking over the courtyard like a loyal sentinel.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle&rsquo;s construction was not without problems however, and one tragedy left a deep mark on Jim. In 1988, his son Roy was playing in the forest near the castle. After running around in the woods, Roy tired himself out and took a nap in a tree trunk. Bishop was cutting down a nearby tree, and only realized where his son was when he heard a horrible sound as the log fell. The boy was crushed to death at the age of 4.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that tragedy, Jim&rsquo;s wife, Phoebe, distanced herself from the castle. But for Jim, the tragedy made his desire to finish it burn ever-brighter. &ldquo;He loved the place,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;What am I gonna do, give up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tower completed at the time was rechristened &ldquo;Roy&rsquo;s Tower.&rdquo; The castle became a memorial. Many speculate that this incident, and the shame that it came with, fed Bishop&rsquo;s monomania to complete the castle. Jim worked even harder, the seeds of his later madness planted in his mind.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This castle grew without any plans more substantial than back-of-the-napkin drawings. The architecture therefore gives an impression of six styles glued together. Flying buttresses reinforce a nordic great hall that itself lays on crude stone shafts that look pre-medieval. Inside the great hall, stained glass appears alongside cheap lawn chairs. As a visitor, you need to allow yourself to be impressed not by the coherence of the place but by the fact that it exists at all.</span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span>If you live nowhere near Colorado and want to experience going inside the castle, </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqaVUoJH2eiw%26ab_channel%3DMeekerExtreme&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170216529&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Mh9gCOnc98xHUW3r25GiK">this video</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a good digital tour.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle&rsquo;s existence doesn&rsquo;t seem at all guaranteed. It was a strange combination of events that led to the castle&rsquo;s existence: in a slightly different timeline it would never be. The castle has faced fierce, structural opposition throughout its history. At the same time Bishop was building the castle, he was waging a legal war for its existence.</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.w81gv21cq8sd"><span class="c25 c39">III: The Forty-Year Siege<br></span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&ldquo;In the early times the castles gave in to gunpowder and battering rams and siege equipment. They were slighted by rulers and also lost to modern means of warfare. In more recent times, castles lost their battles to laws, rules, regulations, zoning codes, building permits, and control by diabolical and insidious politicians, lawyers, and bureaucrats.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span>-- Jim Bishop, </span><span class="c33 c44 c14">Castle Building as I See It</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c33 c44 c14"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lofty ambition of the castle builder, like the pride of Daedalus, led to disasters. Unlike that doomed inventor, however, Jim Bishop was always able to reforge his wings.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty forced him to think outside the box. He built the walls out of granite rocks gathered from ditches in and around San Isabel National Forest. He considered clearing the ditches a public service. The Bureau of Land Management thought differently and interrupted him during a collection to ask for a commercial rock permit. Bishop&rsquo;s insistence that his was a tax-exempt nonprofit held no water. He couldn&rsquo;t afford the prices the BLM demanded.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to overcome this? It is in this experience that Bishop originated the philosophy that animated the rest of his life &ndash; the &ldquo;the power of the public.&rdquo; Bishop came to believe that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; government was the people, not bureaucrats. As long as the people supported his work, bureaucrats had no right to stop it, and Bishop had every right to fight dirty. In his book, </span><span class="c14">Castle Building as I See It,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bishop says he found the BLM &ldquo;doing something unethical&rdquo; and blackmailed them as leverage during negotiations. A settlement was made in which the BLM agreed to sell the rock for only 10 cents a ton.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years of bureaucratic churn later, in the late 70s, the BLM raised the price to 50 cents a ton. Bishop was enraged but charitable. He agreed to the new price, but swore that if it went up one penny more, he&rsquo;d go back to taking the rock for free.</span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">Guess what the BLM did next.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop resorted once again to the power of the public. By this point in history the castle was a minor tourist attraction. He planted a sign on the castle grounds asking visitors to call the BLM and tell them exactly what they thought about price gouging. The BLM office was effectively shut down by phone calls. They crawled back to the negotiating table, and the rocks were never a problem after. .</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did taking the rocks hurt the environment? Some people worry about this when they hear the castle&rsquo;s story. I asked an environmental engineer friend of mine, and here&rsquo;s basically what she had to say:</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the forest service thought it was okay, it&rsquo;s probably justified. Removing rocks from roadside ditches has a bundle of benefits because it improves the channeling of excess water through the ditches. Furthermore, fewer rocks means more room for plants to grow that slow the water&rsquo;s flow, preventing rapid streams that erode the ditches and make them more shallow. One downside may be removing shelter for certain animals.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">In summary: it&rsquo;s complicated, but using local rocks was probably okay.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Other materials for the castle included cement hauled up from Pueblo or occasionally Ca&ntilde;on City. Over time, the materials used grew more complex and an ever-greater proportion of them came from sympathetic donors.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, as tourism grew, so did Bishop&rsquo;s marketing efforts, leading to a parallel battle with the government. One day the government told Bishop he needed to take his homemade sign down and apply for one in accordance with Ladybird Johnson Highway Beautification Act of 1965. The fact that this rule did not apply </span><span class="c14">de facto</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to certain wealthy ski resorts irritated Bishop. He had a big ego and was always irritated by unequal rules.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subversion was his answer. Bishop rebuilt his mailbox into the shape of a castle and painted on it an arrow leading to the property. Since the act technically only applied to signs, the government couldn&rsquo;t use it to remove the mailbox. They tried anyway: after a month they demanded the mailbox be gone, forcing Bishop to draw once again his most fatal weapon. He set up another grievance sign for the public. The highway patrol was inundated with phone calls and relented days later.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wrong to assume that the government was uniformly hostile to Bishop&rsquo;s ambitions. Government in America is no monolith, but a series of interlocking layers like gears on a bicycle, each driving its own chain at its own proper rate. Some layers took a liking to Bishop. The Greenhorn Valley Chamber of Commerce, the economic leaders of the nearby hamlet of Colorado City, encouraged Jim to parade his 1/16th scale model of the castle (which of course built himself), through the town. This brought some extra publicity to the castle but didn&rsquo;t last long. Jim never stuck with any activity he saw as distracting him from his castle-building. He kept poking, though, and persistence paid off. The government did finally install a sign in 1995. That little metal band is a powerful symbol of official recognition. As you drive by, take a moment to its honor. It is the product of immense struggle.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the great hall was completed in the late 90s, Bishop held events there. These ranged from baptisms, weddings, and charitable society meetings to concerts. The latter proved especially difficult. After their first heavy metal concert they swore &ldquo;never again.&rdquo; They swapped the concerts out with now-legendary all-night raves. These were orderly affairs compared to the metal concerts, but they were still drug-filled and got pretty wild, especially with hundreds of people attending. These parties helped Bishop raise enough money to refloor the great hall.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t to last. Neighbors complained about noise, trash, and the destruction of the forest. They eventually succeeded in asking a county judge to forbid any more parties. It was these same neighbors who later started the most perilous assault on the castle. After years of parties, they spurred Custer County to issue a legal injunction against the castle for violating building codes and permit laws. This seems honestly reasonable to me, since every brick screams &ldquo;safety code violation!&rdquo; However, for years Bishop got away with it for a couple of reasons. First: he never charged for entry to the castle, and so it isn&rsquo;t a business and therefore isn&rsquo;t subject to consumer safety laws. Second: when Bishop started building in 1969, Custer County was little more than half-dozen farms and didn&rsquo;t yet have zoning rules.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Custer County of the 1990s thought differently than the Custer county of the 60s. Officials told Bishop he couldn&rsquo;t build anything over 25 feet high, 135 feet less than the square tower at the time. Bishop invoked laches doctrine, stating that if the county does not assert their rights to enforce zoning laws within seven years, they&rsquo;ve given up those rights. For 39 years, the county had allowed Bishop&rsquo;s castle to exist. Exist it would</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;in perpetuum</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this long series of government battles that made Bishop a libertarian. He hated the government for trying to stop his life&rsquo;s work. A soul marked by strong creativity and cantankerousness rarely plays well with bureaucracy.</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.uhguyy4m7dah"><span class="c25 c39">IV: The Merrill Affair<br></span></h2><p class="c15"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Jesus Christ of Nazareth paid the ransom in blood for me on the cross and my motorcycle is part of the eternal inheritance in general&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">- David Merrill</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any good castle, Bishop&rsquo;s Castle had an attempted cult siege.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Merrill came into the lives of the Bishop family after a fire ban ticket. Bishop was ticketed for having a fire on his own property near national forest, and David Merrill stepped in to help him successfully dispute it.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed valuable at first, not just as a friend but as an ally. He had a knack for navigating and subverting the court system and used this to help the Bishops with their perennial government fights. This was made possible in part by his unusual sovereign citizen beliefs. To those blissfully unaware, a sovereign citizen believes that most of what the government does is unconstitutional and that, by refusing &ldquo;consent&rdquo; to government rules, they can make those rules not apply to them. While most sovereign citizen tactics have no legal standing, Merrill&rsquo;s belief in them may have given him confidence useful in stare-downs with county officials.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Bishop&rsquo;s relationship with Merrill soured over time as Merrill&rsquo;s beliefs spiraled further away from sanity. Merrill started to mumble about dark spirits, UFOs, and conspiracies. After a run-in with the law made him lose his motorbike, Merrill sued the Sanhedrin and Jesus Christ himself [link] to get it back.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrill&rsquo;s delusions led him to manipulate others. Jim had a bout with cancer in 2014, and this further hurt his mental health that was already battered by dementia, stress, and nonstop work. As his monomaniacal devotion to the castle thrust him into a brief madness, he was diagnosed with various mental disorders. In 2018, Merrill convinced the weakened Bishop to sign over the trusteeship in the hopes that Merrill could help maintain the castle.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop got way more than he bargained for. Merrill barred the Bishops from entering, redecorated, and renamed it to the &ldquo;Castle Church for the Redemption of the Office Bishop.&rdquo; He intended to make it the headquarters for his pseudochristian cult. The Bishop family incited a movement to retake the castle. Every major Colorado news outlet reported on the battle, and the internet burst aflame with support. Merrill responded to media criticism with this strange rant, which I have reproduced here in very abbreviated form:</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are several key reasons for an irrevocable trust in this case. One is the longevity of the castle itself. Jim built it of granite, not concrete. The concrete holds the granite in place but it is the granite that denies the ravages of gravity. Jim left no bubbles in the mortar too, so moisture and frostwedging may take centuries to take their toll&hellip;. That castle was never owned by Him and Phoebe. &hellip; Think forgive instead of redemption &ndash; CASTLE CHURCH &ndash; For the Forgiving of the Office BISHOP. The Bishop of Rome is the Pope. The true message of Jesus CHRIST was of unity, peace, joy, and love. The popes monetizing of guilt prevents one from stimulating the Kingdom of Heaven from within. Fear and seperation are illusions causing judgement, anxiety, and fear.&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;[sic]</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from a YouTube comment to one of Merrill&rsquo;s old videos, all of which have unfortunately since been taken down, so they&rsquo;re now lost media. He also apparently had a manifesto which I also have not been able to find. Dear reader, if you have any information about David Merrill&rsquo;s philosophy or writings, let me know. I still don&rsquo;t fully understand what drove the man to do all this.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has a happy ending. After much hullabaloo, a judge ruled that Merrill&rsquo;s actions were not done in trust and everything he tried to do was simply undone.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my interview with Jim&rsquo;s son, Dan Bishop, I asked him where Merrill is now. He told me not to contact him-- it would just rile him up. Merrill has since been charged with assaulting his mother and may be in a mental institution now. The castle is safe from him and back in friendly hands.</span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.qwa95kqhuyeg"><span class="c25 c39">V: A Challenge to its Visitors</span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c14">&ldquo;Do you know right now there&rsquo;s traffic on that interstate, and they&#39;re going to Buffallo Bill&rsquo;s Lookout Mountain Grave, they&#39;re going to see things in Denver and Colorado Springs.

I am always dazzled by the bent metal that spikes through nearly every stone. Jim being a metalworker by trade, he excelled in welding and scroll bending. The castle is full of spirals, wheels, twists, and stairs of cold steel. As the visitor climbs upward, they see parts of the castle that were built later when the architect was more skilled, and these decorative metal elements become increasingly structural. The square tower was the first to use steel reinforcements as far down as the foundation.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 233.19px; height: 311.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image105.jpg" style="width: 233.19px; height: 311.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">By far the most impressive ironwork, and something I have seen nowhere else, is the floating path of iron that snakes around the castle walls. You can use this to go from tower to tower and catch some great views of the mountains. I used them to take many of the pictures you see now. You really have to trust in the craftsmanship though, because you can see right through them over 100 feet down to the ground. It&rsquo;s common to see tourists cling to an outer wall as they shakily step along one of the paths.<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 278.05px; height: 340.86px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.jpg" style="width: 492.90px; height: 369.26px; margin-left: -101.11px; margin-top: -20.62px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">I like these floating paths because you wouldn&rsquo;t see anywhere else, probably because they&rsquo;re a legal hazard They&rsquo;re almost certainly not up to codes, so no &ldquo;real&rdquo; attraction would ever have them. But Bishop&rsquo;s Castle has them and lets people make their own decisions about whether to use them or not. It is up to you what risks you want to take, not regulators.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 267.00px; height: 200.08px;"><img alt="" src="images/image109.jpg" style="width: 267.00px; height: 200.08px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">You can climb to the very summit of the castle, but it really is a nail-biting experience. There&rsquo;s no elevator, no handrails, and no guarantees that you will even make it out alive. It&rsquo;s just you and the wind. To go to the top is a feat of daring that I recommend you try, just to show yourself what you&rsquo;re capable of.</span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">The last time I went to the castle, I made the harrowing trek up to the very highest part of the highest tower. The square tower&ndash; as if to playfully exaggerate its own height &ndash; is topped with a pointy hat-like structure made of metal that tapers up and needles the sky. To say you made it to the top, you have to climb up the pyramid. This is the scariest part. The metal, not totally tied down, shivers from the wind. You&rsquo;re on a tiny crag amidst a sea of void. Nothing will stop you from falling hundreds of feet to your death. But as far as is known no one has.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 330.37px; height: 247.56px;"><img alt="" src="images/image59.jpg" style="width: 330.37px; height: 247.56px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c3">I managed to get to the top but only after a storm of stress. The gales howled around me. The metal creaked and shook. I trusted in the castle and was rewarded.<br></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span>On my way down, I noticed the castle is quirky enough to have a nonfunctional elevator shaft. I later read that Bishop wanted to construct a solar-powered elevator inside the castle for accessibility. I suppose an elevator could be possible: if these stones are strong enough to support the massive tower above them, they are strong enough to support an elevator. Bishop, in his book</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;Castle Building as I See It, </span><span class="c3">describes further his vaulting ambition for the castle:</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 274.40px; height: 206.39px;"><img alt="" src="images/image49.jpg" style="width: 274.40px; height: 206.39px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span class="c14">&ldquo;The museum and library will be on the second floor, with a mausoleum addition in the back.

All the same I think holding his expectations so high helped Bishop build what he did. It is good to make your highest ambitions very high indeed. Just like stretching a rubber band a great distance results in greater tension in the cord, stretching your ambitions as high as possible inspires more ardent action.</span></p><p class="c15 c64"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 323.98px; height: 270.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image71.png" style="width: 323.98px; height: 270.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c72" id="h.8dnace27ksgm"><span class="c25 c39">VI: Place of Liberty<br></span></h2><p class="c15"><span class="c14">&ldquo;The rich and poor equally have to obey the law.&rdquo;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 278.21px; height: 371.20px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 278.21px; height: 371.20px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop hoped that the castle would be &ldquo;a place of freedom, hope, and justice.&rdquo; I have already mentioned how the bureaucratic attacks on the castle led him to see it as a monument to the people.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this attitude at times bled into insanity, I still have to admit how impressed I am by his dogged devotion to the people. He felt the idea for the castle belonged to the public and so never charged for entry. The castle has served the public many times: by 1980, there had already been nine weddings, two baptisms, a wedding anniversary, a funeral, and an internment. People have bought engraved stained-glass panels in the castle as memorials for their loved ones. I think the castle lives up to its reputation as a populist monument.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, Bishop&rsquo;s extreme libertarian views do grate at times. The signs strewn about the grounds serve as mouthpieces for Bishop. While some are reasonable, like the one warning visitors to be careful in the castle, others are eye-rolling, like the one comparing campfire regulations to literal slavery.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan told me that his father&rsquo;s views became more extreme over time and bled into his mental instability as he aged. It got to the point where he would wear his family out with loud antigovernment rants that rambled on and on. People increasingly found him difficult to be around. In the late 2000s and 2010s, some tourists reported that he screamed incoherently at them. Warnings about these jeremiads became a staple of guidebook entries about Bishop&rsquo;s Castle. Once in a while, a tourist would rile him up on purpose by telling him that he couldn&rsquo;t do something or defending regulation.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most aesthetically libertarian aspect of the place is the animals running around. There are dogs, cats, goats, and chickens just hanging out without any cage or fence. I don&rsquo;t know why and the family doesn&rsquo;t seem to really know, either. You can just reach out and pet the goats, and this was one of the very few times that I&rsquo;ve pet a goat that wasn&rsquo;t on the other side of a fence.

Certainly that was always a motivating factor. Bishop relentlessly pursued publicity, to the point that he got angry for the absurd reason that the governor of Colorado, Roy Romer, didn&rsquo;t visit the castle during his 1989 tour of the state. The castle was a way for Bishop to draw attention to himself when otherwise he would have stepped through life unknown.<br></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he grew older, Bishop fell under the yoke of dementia and other mental illnesses. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. These may have had as much to do with his lifestyle and monomaniacal thinking as his age. He thought of nothing but the castle-- for months on end, he&rsquo;d leave his wife alone in Pueblo to pursue solitary labor. He took many knocks to the head during construction.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rare times when he was at home, he was increasingly difficult to live with.

The munchkin is the type of person who answers &ldquo;why?&rdquo; with &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; They&rsquo;re dragged along by an extremely strong inner sense of purpose. To us, they seem to possess infinite energy and firm self-discipline. To them, it&rsquo;s just Tuesday.</span></p><p class="c15 c21"><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve met a few munchkins. Nothing gives me a taste for life quite like they do. Every time, I leave convinced that they draw close to the bones of what it is to be human. That they understand better than anyone why we&rsquo;re here. Maybe you&rsquo;ve met a munchkin. Maybe you are one.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society needs munchkins to explore the borderlands of possibility space. They are the wild ones in the forest, scouting new paths. They are the goal-makers and the thrill-seekers. Nearly all will fail, but those who don&rsquo;t will succeed hard enough to justify every failure. It&rsquo;s the same logic startup funders use. Was Bishop&rsquo;s Castle a victory for munchkinry? Maybe, maybe not. But there&rsquo;s no doubt that it was an attempt by a munchkin.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preserving the pursuit of happiness and keeping it a true pursuit requires some legal and social slack in society. We need to tolerate our munchkins and let them be weird. They carve out the space of what can be done, allowing more thorough souls to fill it in with work and innovation.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bishop started the castle, America was a munchkinland. A country with way more space than finger-waggers will always be a munchkin&rsquo;s paradise. Now an older, more crowded society, America today fails its munchkins. We as a society attacked Bishop relentlessly and the castle endured only because of his own hardiness and sheer arrogance. What of the more tender-hearted munchkins? Their projects stay unfinished. Society makes sure of that.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bishop had started building today in 2025, he&rsquo;d face a much more daunting task. Adjusting for inflation, Jim paid about $2000 per acre for the land in 1959. Today </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20250416191321/https://www.land.com/property/2.13-acres-in-custer-county-colorado/22698610/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170256467&amp;usg=AOvVaw0m1dTICpc5atEQkDZl4lrT">a comparable lot</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;goes for $41,000 per acre, a twentyfold difference.</span></p><p class="c15"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let&rsquo;s say our hypothetical 21</span><span class="c74">st</span><span class="c3">-century Bishop made some well-timed Bitcoin investments. He&rsquo;d have to pay much more for the rocks, assuming he could legally obtain them. Materials would eat more of the budget, as would property taxes. Custer County zoning regulations would force the project to be about 100 feet less ambitious. After all this, it would take a truly hardy munchkin to not give up. The only element of 21st-century castle-building that would be easier is marketing. With the internet, you don&rsquo;t need road signs. Bishop&rsquo;s castle amazes us in part because it&rsquo;s a symbol of his triumph over busybodies and naysayers. But it&rsquo;s also a symbol of the more informal world that has passed. Our world today is institutional and digital, and has little room for castle-builders.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I even wonder if the castle will last much longer. The family has been lucky so far, but it only takes one death or injury to result in a shutdown. When I mentioned this possibility to Dan, he had this to say:</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ultimately, we don&rsquo;t have any game plan. &hellip; Your question is the same one people have asked since we started. There&rsquo;s always somebody wanting to plant the idea that it&rsquo;s not going to work. That they&rsquo;re going to take it from you.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just can&rsquo;t let the fear of the future stop you from doing what you want to do. The thing you gotta be careful of is: Is it for the right reason? I believe that as long as I&rsquo;m up there, not trying to get rich, not trying to steal from everybody, giving it away, than the God I and my Dad believed in will do what he needs to keep it going. I also believe that if it&rsquo;s not happening anymore&hellip; that was God&rsquo;s will as well.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go when God tells me I&rsquo;m done here. I live by that because I watched it work for him. That there were years of no one managing to stop it is a pretty good testament of how long you can get away with doing the right thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan tells us here what the castle means. The castle might not teach us much about architecture or environmental engineering, but it reminds us to let hope and not fear guide our lives. It reminds us that the true munchkin doesn&rsquo;t always lay out plans like railroad tracks but digs, digs, digs through the mountain of destiny in a frenzy of joyful doing.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of us know whether the castle will stay decades or centuries hence. But as long as the castle stands on the mountainside, it whispers to those who visit: &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c21 c140"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.3yyw3u52wh8j"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.rgmjepmfuxe8"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.bfs5llwvqdi0"><span class="c24">Bite Me: A Review of Teeth as Evolution&rsquo;s Leftovers and Modern Shame</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.5ncfytfwaxi0"><span class="c25 c39">1.

Humans get exactly two sets before the slow, relentless crawl of dental entropy sets in. Somewhere along the evolutionary road, mammals struck a bargain; </span><span class="c14">you&#39;ll get by</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For most, this compromise was good enough. Then we outlived sabre-tooths, discovered agriculture, and invented caramel. The rest is pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So consider this a performance review. A product audit, 300 million years after rollout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Teeth are rigid, resilient, and marvelously overbuilt. They&rsquo;re the only skeletal feature audacious enough to breach the surface of living flesh. They precede us in the fossil record, they outlast us in grave soil, and they sit in our jaws as bony knives laced with nerves, tasked with breaking down the world and warning us when the world fights back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Evolution gave us teeth as a short-term solution, and we turned them into lifelong commitments. When humans developed agriculture, sugar, alcohol, and the social nightmare of halitosis, our mouths became perpetual battlefields. And yet, biologically speaking, the design never updated. There&rsquo;s no redundancy, no regeneration, and no feedback mechanism beyond pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">When I learned I had cavities, the news arrived not through pain, but through silence. The dentist pointed at an X-ray showing small, shadowy voids hidden between my teeth, the kind you don&rsquo;t feel until they&#39;re well beyond prevention. These voids, he explained, were the consequence of trusting surface-level hygiene. Then he handed me a sample pack of floss, like a priest prescribing penance for sins I hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;d committed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Evolution never planned for this. There were no savannah grasses designed to floss hominid teeth. No Paleolithic hunter died lamenting, &ldquo;If only I&#39;d flossed.&rdquo;[1] Yet today, neglecting this small ritual can cost hundreds of dollars and invite silent judgment from the Order of the Sacred Floss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Elsewhere in your body, bacteria constitute a threat. In your mouth, they&#39;re a civilization. Your teeth are ancient stone outposts in microbial marshlands. Night after night, you dutifully drag sterile thread through these bacterial trenches, hoping not to miss a spot. It&#39;s absurd yet strangely admirable: an endless act of defiance in defense of structures evolution neglected to equip us to maintain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is not just hygiene. It&#39;s devotion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.jtrsnshyd8m3"><span class="c25 c39">2. Functional Elegance, Structural Compromise</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Viewed through an engineer&#39;s lens, human teeth appear impressively compact, durable, and efficient. Enamel, the hardest substance in the human body, forms incisors, canines, and molars meticulously arranged for puncturing, tearing, and grinding. These are conveniently mounted in bone, optimizing food processing without requiring limb involvement. Strong marks if you&#39;re grading for biomechanical elegance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But elegance quickly fades under scrutiny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unlike sharks and many reptiles, which regenerate teeth endlessly from a dedicated stem-cell niche, mammals made an early economic choice; they deleted the regenerative blueprint (the dental lamina) once adult teeth were installed. This decision is irrevocably encoded in our developmental biology. You receive exactly two sets. After that, the scaffolding vanishes, leaving the bones of your face to fend for themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There was logic here. Mammals evolved occluding teeth, upper and lower molars fitting in precise, interlocking patterns. Anthropoid primates like chimpanzees and gorillas can subsist on tough, fibrous fruits and leaves precisely because those interlocking surfaces let them shear vegetation. In such a system, tooth regeneration isn&#39;t just redundant, it&#39;s potentially disastrous. A single misaligned replacement tooth could compromise the entire bite, disrupt jaw alignment, and reduce chewing efficiency. Sharks, with teeth dropping out in neat rows like vending machine snacks, evade this problem entirely. For mammals, this would be chaos. Nature gave us teeth that were meant to last just long enough. We are the ones who overstayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So evolution chose stability: a finite set of timed, interlocking parts, built to carry us through childhood, adolescence, and a brief reproductive window. Just two installations, with no backup system. It worked, mostly. Lifespans were short. Diets were tough but sugarless. But then came agriculture, and a Paleolithic jaw system was left to navigate a supermarket. Teeth meant for tendon met Skittles, soda, and the accidental crunch of a popcorn kernel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Then there&#39;s pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Teeth are profoundly innervated. Their sensory input is routed through the trigeminal nerve, which transmits touch, pressure, and temperature with agonizing intensity. This wasn&#39;t a design flaw; it was evolutionary guidance. Pain was a deterrent: chew softer, avoid injury, stop eating if necessary. In the absence of dentistry or antibiotics pain was the only corrective mechanism available, incapable of healing but powerful enough to encourage behavioral adaptation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This adaptive response remains intact, even today. Tooth pain prompts action: antibiotics, root canals, extractions. However, the relationship between pain and consequence has changed dramatically. A cracked molar once risked starvation or sepsis. The alarm still sounds, but the consequences have shifted. What once threatened survival now threatens time, money, and comfort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Occasionally, the alarm misfires catastrophically. Trigeminal neuralgia, one of the most painful conditions in medicine, disrupts the same nerve pathway which evolved to warn us of injury. Instead, it delivers lightning-like pain in response to harmless stimuli such as wind, water, even blinking. In these cases pain no longer signals damage, it becomes noise. The system is not obsolete, but vulnerable to distortion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ultimately, teeth represent a tolerable compromise, a mid-tier biological product with daily upkeep and frequent catastrophic failures. Yet beneath the surface, something shifted profoundly. We began patching cracks, plugging holes, encasing decay in gold. The jaw remained static, while the meaning of the mouth evolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.uxy1oo4a4neb"><span><br></span><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">3. Symbolic Function: Teeth as Social Currency</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><br>In Neolithic burial sites across the Indus Valley archaeologists have found molars with small, deliberate holes drilled into them: likely to relieve pressure or decay. By the time we get to the Mayans, dental modifications were ornamental. Jade, turquoise, and hematite were precision-drilled into the front teeth of elites as symbols of power and divine affiliation. The shift had begun from survival to status.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Consider Edo-period Japan&rsquo;s practice of ohaguro, or tooth blackening. A mixture of iron filings, vinegar, and tannins was applied repeatedly until the teeth became glossy black. Samurai and aristocratic women proudly displayed their artificially darkened enamel as evidence of refinement and moral discipline. Here, a visible mouth became a visible vow; a cultural act inscribed directly onto the enamel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Across the ocean in Bali, another form of dental symbolism emerged: the potong gigi ceremony, in which adolescents have their upper canines ritually filed down. Smoothing of sharp edges represents the suppression of primal impulses and the entry of the individual into the social and moral community. This isn&rsquo;t about improving the bite; it&#39;s about aligning the body with the soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">What makes teeth uniquely susceptible to symbolic transformation is their persistent visibility. Unlike internal organs or bones concealed by flesh, teeth constantly signal to others in acts as ordinary as speech, smiles, or even grimaces. They become social currency precisely because we cannot hide them. Not easily, not for long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Modern America isn&rsquo;t exempt from this logic. Our dental interventions of whitening, straightening and alignment, are rituals no less symbolic than ohaguro or potong gigi, even if we prefer not to frame them as such. We believe, often implicitly, that teeth function as credentials for the face carrying an enormous social payload. Straight teeth suggest affluence, discipline, responsible parenting, good health insurance, while crooked or yellowing teeth imply neglect, chaos, or poverty. When a molar cracks quietly in your mouth, the question isn&#39;t merely what happened. It&#39;s what moral or social failing allowed it to occur.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Yet biology itself doesn&rsquo;t moralize decay, it simply allows it. Your enamel can be immaculate and still succumb to chance. You can floss with zeal and still fracture a tooth overnight. But culturally, we rarely recognize dental collapse as mere bad luck. We see it as confession.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So we intervene. We bleach, cap, sculpt. Not because biology demands perfection, but because culture demands performance. The mouth is both interface and advertisement, the intersection of biology and expectation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A smile is one of the most intensely curated gestures in modern life. In certain cultures such as Russia and Japan, excessive smiling reads as disingenuous or socially inappropriate. In others, particularly America, failure to smile may be interpreted as a social failing. This is a lot to ask of a set of calcium spires evolved for tearing roots and meat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This symbolic function isn&#39;t universal, but it&rsquo;s ubiquitous. Different cultures may disagree about what teeth should represent: virtue or vanity, submission or strength. But nearly all agree that they represent something important. To neglect them is to fall out of step with the tribe. For a product review that&rsquo;s not a flaw, that&rsquo;s market dominance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.t8wz78piv85n"><span class="c25 c39">4. Institutional Blind Spots: The Body Ends at the Gums</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Teeth occupy a liminal zone in healthcare: too cosmetic for medicine, too medical for cosmetics. They are structurally neglected even as they shape our social identity and impact systemic health. Our institutions didn&rsquo;t resolve this contradiction, instead they enshrined it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In the United States, dental insurance typically exists as an optional separate rider. It&rsquo;s capped at around $1,500 annually, a figure barely adjusted since 1972 despite healthcare inflation exceeding 700%. Basic preventive services? Mostly covered. But anything structural, such as crowns, implants, orthodontics, rapidly exhausts coverage limits. The clear implication: your teeth aren&rsquo;t strictly &quot;health&quot;. They&rsquo;re optional attachments. Luxury bones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But the body doesn&#39;t respect arbitrary insurance carve-outs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Consider a dental abscess. Even severe infections, causing facial swelling, fever, and escalating cellulitis, rarely qualify for coverage under traditional medical insurance. An emergency department will likely prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, and instructions to &quot;see a dentist.&quot; No dentist available, affordable, or in-network? You&rsquo;re sent home with a handout and worsening infection. That is, until it becomes severe enough to cross an invisible threshold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">That threshold appears when bacteria escape the jaw and enter systemic circulation, infecting heart valves, invading the airway, or seeding deep tissues. Suddenly, a formerly &quot;cosmetic&quot; abscess becomes a systemic medical crisis. The patient is hospitalized, treated with intravenous antibiotics, and may require open-heart surgery along with tens of thousands of dollars in medical care. At this point, the dental origin of infection is finally acknowledged as a medical emergency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Our healthcare system treats oral health as preventive care in reverse. We subsidize statins to reduce cardiac risk. We monitor precancerous lesions to prevent tumors before they form. But with oral health, the logic flips. We wait until structural collapse becomes undeniable, and only then do we intervene. The goal is not to restore teeth, but to contain the collateral damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Orthodontics illustrates this perversely well. Slightly crooked teeth are deemed cosmetic until they trigger chronic jaw pain, speech impediments, or soft-tissue trauma. Even then, coverage remains elusive until an arbitrary threshold of severity is crossed, often requiring pediatric Medicaid eligibility and radiographic proof. A misaligned jaw doesn&rsquo;t wait for actuarial approval. It just keeps damaging itself until someone calls it medically necessary. Mechanical breakdown is a prerequisite to financial support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This false binary between cosmetic vanity and medical necessity isn&rsquo;t clinical; it&rsquo;s cultural. Teeth are uniquely visible, and therefore their failure is performative. A rotting molar isn&rsquo;t merely a health issue; it&rsquo;s interpreted as a public sign of neglect or poverty. Institutions penalize visibility by treating most preventive care as elective vanity. Yet, simultaneously, society demands visible dental perfection as baseline social currency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The deeper problem isn&rsquo;t neglect, it&rsquo;s equilibrium. Most people already pay out of pocket, and do so without organized resistance. Insurers have no reason to expand coverage for a service that patients tolerate paying for. Meanwhile, professional bodies like the American Dental Association have long opposed integrating dental care into Medicare. And because dental crises are urgent, unsubsidized, and often agonizing, they don&rsquo;t lend themselves to market discipline. No one compares quotes with a swollen face. The system persists not because it works, but because it doesn&rsquo;t quite collapse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We&#39;ve constructed a healthcare model where the mouth is marketized but never fully medicalized, where function and appearance are intertwined yet administratively severed, and where social participation hinges on the concealment of inevitable anatomical wear.</span></p><p class="c0 c27 c108"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c108 c1 c27"><span class="c3">This isn&#39;t merely bureaucratic oversight. It&#39;s cultural belief enacted into policy: the body ends at the gums. Until inevitably it doesn&#39;t, and by then it&#39;s usually too late to save the tooth.</span></p><p class="c108 c1 c27"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.nepn69gys1su"><span class="c25 c39">5. The Dream of Collapse</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The most common anxiety dream in the world is not drowning, or falling, or being chased.<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s your teeth, coming loose. You wake up probing each molar with your tongue, half-certain the loss was real. The relief is immediate, but beneath it is recognition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Teeth are the body&rsquo;s first quiet betrayal. They don&rsquo;t heal. They don&rsquo;t regenerate. Once gone they leave a permanent aperture, not just in the jaw but in the self. A vacancy. A truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Psychologists call it a dream of powerlessness or exposure. Freud, predictably, framed it as castration. But maybe it&rsquo;s simpler than that. Maybe the dream is just honest: a reminder that the body is a temporary arrangement of matter, and that we are already beginning to fall apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We joke about the dentist. We dread the chair, the bright light, the instruments. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But the real fear isn&rsquo;t just pain. It&rsquo;s inspection. It&rsquo;s being read. A dentist doesn&rsquo;t just treat you; they reveal you. Your mouth becomes evidence. You lie back and someone tells you, gently, how long you&rsquo;ve been failing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c95"><span class="c3">So maybe the dream isn&rsquo;t an omen. Maybe it&rsquo;s practice, a quiet rehearsal for the losses we aren&rsquo;t ready to name.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Teeth don&rsquo;t lie. They speak first, and they speak plainly. And what they tell us, night after night, in silence, is that the collapse has already begun.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c99" id="h.ty9j3ayxdttp"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c9">6. The Endgame of Teeth: Persistence and the Illusion of Wholeness</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c95"><span class="c3">Teeth today are high-maintenance symbols. Like legacy software we can&#39;t retire, they demand constant patching and anxious vigilance. Twice-daily brushing, nightly flossing, retainers, guards, crowns, implants. Quiet rituals performed before bathroom mirrors to maintain the illusion of permanence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">But teeth don&#39;t fail quietly. They send flares of pain along nerves wired directly into consciousness. A cracked molar can rewrite your life around the axis of pain. For teeth, subtlety is useless.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">And yet, once structural failure sets in, we don&rsquo;t stop. We crown and cap and bridge. We reconstruct what was lost, not to restore function, but to preserve form. The mouth becomes less an organ than a stage set, a performance of intactness atop a vanished foundation.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Somehow, it works. We eat, we smile, we pass. Teeth become not just anatomy but dignity, scaffolding for a self presented to the world.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The tragedy isn&rsquo;t that they fail. It&rsquo;s that their failure breaks the illusion we were meant to believe: that biology was ever permanent, that upkeep could outrun entropy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Teeth remind us what the body is: temporary architecture, constantly patched, inevitably crumbling. We cover the cracks with porcelain and smiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">ENDNOTES<br><br>[1] </span><span class="c106">&nbsp;Technically, there&rsquo;s some archaeological evidence that Paleolithic humans used primitive toothpicks.

At their best, British people are kind and fiercely close to their good friends and treat laughter as the best medicine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, the UK is also just...depressing. It&#39;s further north than any part of the contiguous United States. In the winter, the sun rises at 8 in the morning and sets at 3 in the afternoon. The sea air means that there&#39;s a damp that chills your bones unless you put on about 4 different fuzzy sweaters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The worst thing, though, is that almost the entire country seems to be trapped in a pit of pessimism. To the British, nothing can ever get better. What&#39;s worse, thinking that it might get better is crazy talk for crazy people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Any kind of deviation from this institutional pessimism is ambition and individualist thinking. Things that disrupt the fabric of British society. At their worst the British can be like crabs in a bucket - noticing any time you start crawling towards freedom and pulling you back in, in case you get ideas above your station.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So, if you grow up in the UK and you&#39;re ambitious and individualistic and nonconformist, it can feel like there&#39;s no place for you in a country content to complain and not actually do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In that case, where do you go?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.z6zo45ywwnvd"><span class="c34">United Kingdom: Husband</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Britain was the first country I ever went to outside of North America (I&rsquo;d been to Mexico and Canada) and I went there because I married a British person &ndash; I should specify, a British immigrant. Not an English person. A British person. A person with no genetic connection to Britain whatsoever. We didn&rsquo;t stay beyond the 6 month length of my tourist visa. My father in-law was so very surprised by this, despite us telling him repeatedly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The food really isn&rsquo;t as bad as people claim that it is. When made properly, it&rsquo;s got a sort of comforting subtlety to it, with soft and warm and rich flavors. It&rsquo;s comforting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Some things are exactly as bad as you think. This country is a weird soft-and-cuddly-authoritarian nightmare where nothing quite works anymore and it&rsquo;s illegal to make bad social media posts. I was once hit by a car and didn&rsquo;t receive an ambulance when I called emergency services because my case was judged as not being bad enough. <br><br>Some things are just weird. They&rsquo;re actually incredibly incredibly violent as people. People will just start punching each other in public over mild disagreements. You can get in a fistfight by looking too hard at the wrong sort of person &ndash; all of the guys I&rsquo;m thinking of were white, this isn&rsquo;t an immigrant thing, British people are just awful &ndash; and people barely react to fights happening in front of them on the street. It just doesn&rsquo;t show up in statistics because people don&rsquo;t even bother to report it, and no one can so much as carry around a screwdriver so no one actually gets killed in this. It&rsquo;s just regularized low-stakes violence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Your speech is policed, and you might get punched at any time &ndash; Britain is a bit like being in highschool again. Speaking of childishness, British people are actually a LOT more vulgar and a lot more emotional than Americans. I&rsquo;m not sure where the idea came from that it was the reverse. British people are much more willing to get emotional over even tiny problems, and their newspaper headlines all read like things a shitty teenage boy would write. The subtext of every America ad is that this product will make you sexy. The subtext of every British ad is that this product will allow you to embrace the pure and innocent joy of a retarded child. I get the sense that every real adult immigrated to America, and something is missing from the basic genepool of England. <br><br>As an aside, I have figured out why Britain is so damned weird about trans women. It&rsquo;s because genetically English women look like men. It is so easy to be a passing English trans woman. The native English cis woman can&rsquo;t just smile and nod at trans women &ndash; there&rsquo;s a real threat of the categories of cis women and trans women being mixed up, here. I can see how that might cause somewhat more panic than trans women do in more attractive countries. <br><br>Yes, the immigrants. The inevitable paragraph about the immigrants. It&rsquo;s required, isn&rsquo;t it. Here&rsquo;s the thing about London. You have a very clear image of London in your head. Or maybe a fuzzy one. But either way, it&rsquo;s a London that </span><span class="c14">is English</span><span class="c3">. This is not an accurate mental image. Maybe in 1950 it was accurate. But in 2025? No. London is 40% White English. This is very jarring, even if you are not a racist, even if you are not even particularly fond of the English, for the simple reason that anything being not what you had always imagined it to be your whole life is jarring. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Large parts of London are very very clearly immigrant &ndash; the shops have non-English labeling, the people aren&rsquo;t white, etc., etc.. Large parts of London are sort of&hellip; international-feeling. Like they could be in any city in the world &ndash; if you look carefully, there&rsquo;s clear signs in the little details of the buildings and such that you are in fact in Britain, but in some universal sense a McDonald&rsquo;s is a McDonald&rsquo;s and a Starbucks is a Starbucks and a McDonald&rsquo;s analogue that serves Korean food instead is that, and a Starbucks analogue that has a different name is that as well. A few isolated parts of London are very distinctly and intentionally English. These are my least favorite parts of England. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The immigrant parts are simply what they are. A family-owned Lebanese grocery store doesn&rsquo;t have some plan to be a family-owned Lebanese or Kurdish or whatever grocery store. It&rsquo;s family-owned because a guy started a grocery store and he needed his kids to work there. His brother is a butcher at the back counter. His other brother ended up baking the fresh naan. It&rsquo;s Lebanese because he&rsquo;s Lebanese, or it&rsquo;s Kurdish because he&rsquo;s Kurdish. It serves naan and samosas without a second thought, because he doesn&rsquo;t really care if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;truly Lebanese&rdquo; or not. He wants to sell these, and his customers want to buy them. It&rsquo;s organic. It&rsquo;s honest. Their prices are low, their products are good, and they smile at you obligingly. So, you shop there all the time. <br><br>The English parts are planned down to the smallest detail. There&rsquo;s a committee, probably government, that&rsquo;s designed around making sure that it&rsquo;s perfectly and properly English, whatever they decide that that means. Obviously, deciding that it&rsquo;s Perfectly And Properly English means attaching everything to some imagined glorious past &ndash; what is English is a moving target. Obviously, some things are, and some things aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not a meaningless term &ndash; but just as obviously, it changes over time. What was English in 1025 is not what is English in 2025. So these committee buildings &ndash; restaurants or museums or apartment blocks or neighborhoods &ndash; feel inorganic and planned and tacky and fake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The English parts of England are when England is least itself, which raises the obvious question of what exactly an England is or what an Englishman is. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think that Britain knows anymore either. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons that their politics is so weird these past 20 or so years. They&#39;re trying to fix something, and they don&rsquo;t even know what it is or how it operates under ideal conditions or what it&rsquo;s supposed to do if they do somehow fix it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">London is not the worst city in the world. But it is a dirty violent nothing-vibe of a place and it&rsquo;s incredibly expensive. It is not the worst city in the world, but it might be the worst value-for-money city in the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.jktw4cpojcnw"><span class="c25 c39">United States: Husband</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;m from here. <br><br>If I&rsquo;m smart enough and lucky enough I&rsquo;ll never ever have to go back here. <br><br>Nothing good ever happened to me in America, in retrospect, other than marrying my wife. This happened after she was in America for perhaps 2 months. We had known each other online for quite some time before this, and now travel the world together. I now realize that this sounds like I am getting duped or taken advantage of. She is richer than me. I just have a cooler, more interesting life than you, probably. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I used to not feel like an American, when I lived in America. I didn&rsquo;t think much of American ideals. Now I feel differently. It turns out that when I am the only American in the room, &ldquo;being American&rdquo; is the most important fact about me, and when I am faced with non-American ideals, or lack thereof, I think quite highly of American ideals. <br><br>America is a great idea, but it is an expensive dirty place with ugly cities and it is impossible to walk anywhere. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s only really by leaving your home country that you learn anything about it, I suppose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.ei94549i9cgr"><span class="c34">United States: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I wanted to lead into this section not just because of American ideas about individualism and self-reliance, but also because...well...my husband is American. So, when we started dating, the US was the first place I headed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It feels a bit dishonest to try and write a review of the entire United States, given that it&#39;s a huge country and I only saw a tiny part of it, but it also feels dishonest not to talk about the massive culture shock I experienced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The first thing that struck me is that everything really is bigger in America. Of course portion sizes are pretty big and cars are pretty big, but there&#39;s so much more. Everything in Portland felt so much more spread out compared to growing up in the dense mass of things and people that is London. Just to get to the gas station to pick up groceries I had to walk several blocks. And I was shocked by how much bigger houses and apartments are in America than in Britain; in Manchester, I thought I was hot shit for being able to afford to rent a 450 sqft apartment. My now-husband&#39;s poky little apartment was maybe twice that size, and he even had his own window AC unit whereas I had to ration heating. It made me a little anxious. Nothing felt me-sized; everything felt like it was designed for a different person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The second thing that struck me is that Portland felt terribly lonely. Granted, I was there in 2021 so nothing really felt quite real or normal, but to get anywhere you had to go from your home-bubble and drive in your car-bubble to anywhere you wanted to go, and then you had to get back into your car-bubble to drive back to your home-bubble. The overall effect was that I felt horribly isolated in a new country, even when I would have considered myself to have a strong support system. I learned later that many Americans think of friendship differently from British people, and that displays of emotion or affection I would consider normal are frowned upon as inappropriate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Still, there is much to recommend the American people, who can be more honest and direct than the British and who seem to truly value being exceptional. I am a strange person, and while the British largely seem put off by this the Americans seem to find my strangeness charming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There is also much to recommend American landscapes. Their mountain ranges are some of the most impressive I have ever seen. For my bachelorette party I went to Mount St Helens and it absolutely blew my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, I spent about half of my time in the States laid up with terrible stomach pain. I have IBS. Something about the food in the US just disagrees with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.sgi99kdmwn3k"><span class="c25 c39">Czechia: Husband</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I first came here because my wife took me here for my first birthday I celebrated with her, my first birthday outside of America, my first birthday as an exile. She wanted me to see the sights and beauty of Prague. Prague was beautiful, like something out of a Wes Anderson movie or a fairy tale. It is where Hollywood goes to film London, because London itself does not look enough like London to Hollywood. It is everything that an American romanticizes Europe as being, which is to say, very unlike almost any part of Europe. The streets of the old town wind haphazardly past shops selling weed and candy and overpriced tourist tat, all decorated with the stucco and stone of hundreds upon hundreds of years of central European empire, the buildings shifting seamlessly between medieval masonry and 1920s Art Nouveau stone, statues of nymphs and generals leaping out into your vision unexpectedly as you turn out of random wanderings through a nonsense labyrinth and happen upon a plaza upon which many buildings face; and in these moments, it becomes clearer to you that you are walking into what was once some village&rsquo;s square around which all the woodend huts were built, and what you have wandered along were desire paths carved through mud by human feet and wagon wheels and horse hooves over 1000 years ago; and it has all been built over and built over again, on and on again, and the weight of history rolls along under your feet in the cobblestones you can feel and you feel 10 feet tall knowing that you are in the center of something, even if on the surface no place could matter less than some post-communist country of no particular importance that will almost always be someone&rsquo;s client state &ndash; next who knows, now Brussels, then Americas, before that Russia&rsquo;s, before that Austria&rsquo;s, and only before that was it free and clear to be the kingdom of Bohemia. You stroll on through, past statues of gold and jet and stone, past filigree, stumbling into a restaurant that was founded in 1880 and looks it, through crowds, gazing upon copper-green roofs and little details carved into the stone running along the bottoms of drug stores and lingerie shops, onto a perfect 1920s Art Nouveau street car that is inexplicably a major form of public transportation here &ndash; which takes you on past jazz clubs and brothels and coffee shops that proudly advertise that you can pay in bitcoin. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The city&rsquo;s housing is 70% airbnbs, though. It is a theme park, designed to make tourists like me feel incredible so that we part with our money. I once talked with my Uber driver as he took me to the airport, and he told me that he had been on a police assault team there. He&rsquo;d loved it; he&rsquo;d loved the thrill, he&rsquo;d loved the comradery, he&rsquo;d loved protecting his community, he&rsquo;d loved being a hero; he was a handsome and well-muscled man, and it was easy to imagine him as such. But, he said, he&rsquo;d had to give all that up because Uber paid more than that. I was very upset by this, though tried not to show it, and probably expressed my condolences to him poorly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><br>The stereotypical Czech dish is in three parts &ndash; a fluffy yet rich egg-and-flour dumpling that&rsquo;s white and full of visible sponge-like holes when it&rsquo;s sliced up on your plate, which it always comes as already. Next to it is something of meat and roasted &ndash; pork, wild boar, venison, and rabbit have all made a showing on my plate. Sometimes it&rsquo;s breaded before roasting, sometimes it comes to your plate bare, but always the meat is juicy and tender. Third, all across the plate, drowning dumpling and meat, is the sauce &ndash; a rich cream gravy flavored with paprika and vegetables and more things than I can name or am certain of. But it is thick and I could have a whole meal of nothing but that. Alongside this trinity is a massive glass of light high-noted richly acidic beer, at times literally sold for less than the price of water, and in my opinion the best in the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I returned to Czechia 2 times after this. <br><br>Once on a roadtrip with my boss to see a variety of Czech properties for her to put her company campus in; I found an income-generating property that fit all of her wildest requirements within a 45-minute train ride of Prague, for half of her budget. She fucked around for 6 months doing ketamine rather than buying it. She is a well-intentioned woman and I wish her the best, but she is not much in contact with reality; though, frankly, that&rsquo;s probably why I even got to work with her in the first place; she hired me because I was her favorite blogger. I hadn&rsquo;t made a post in over 18 months, at the time. The Czech countryside is not as magnificent as Prague &ndash; it is almost all a nearly-American pastoral highway-broken emptiness dotted with 900-year old villages with beautiful coble streets and gilded clocks on disused guildhalls, next to hardware stores that advertise paint with bare-breasted models. They are very sexually libertine. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The real estate agents were mostly liars and cheats and layabouts who knew nothing of their business or product, and the countryside often had that emptied-out feeling from hyperurbanization &ndash; in village after village it was hard not to notice that it was only the old left. The young had fled; perhaps to Prague, perhaps to Brno, perhaps westward into Germany and France and the Benelux, those economic giants of sclerotic Europe, Europe of the never-ending Great Recession, Europe who makes nothing, Europe sheltering under the American security umbrella while whining about American barbarousness, Europe of whiners and Europe the museum-continent. There were still some young people in only two villages, and interestingly, those two had two of the most promising properties &ndash; not that, in the end, it mattered at all. My boss spent 6 months doing ketamine rather than actually purchasing the place. She also never gave me a clear look at her own financials. I honestly don&rsquo;t understand why she hired me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"><br>The last time I returned (and perhaps for the final time) for a few hours with my wife to see it on a layover while we were transiting from Portugal to Cyprus at a deeply inopportune time in deeply disappointing circumstances that would later grow worse, though this is not the place or time for that story. <br><br>That time, it was hard not to see it as a tourist trap, the crowds swelled with late December and the air biting at us &ndash; we had our delicious meal and our delicious beer, we had our wander through the streets. Overall, the experience was as magical as always, but by that time, I was aware of the synthetic nature of that magic even as I found it enchanting. That sort of double-consciousness creates something of a struggle within oneself, and while it does not prevent my enjoying the city, it does keep me from relaxing fully into that enjoyment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.qctif9d6e1p0"><span class="c34">Czechia: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&#39;ve only really been to Prague and the surrounding areas, but they&#39;re beautiful.

In the West, Georgia is probably best known for getting itself confused with the US state of the same name. To digital nomads, Georgia is known as that one place where you can just turn up and stay for a year without a visa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I think Georgia has some of the most beautiful scenery I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. In our flat in Tbilisi, we could wake up every day and see the great hills that rise on either side of the city. I also think Georgia has, hands down, the best wine in the world. I love the total and utter lack of bureaucracy, where you can just do anything - so different from the stifling dystopia of rules that the UK can be. I also miss our adopted cat very much. He died of kidney failure about a year after we took him in. Georgia has some very sweet cats and dogs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, Georgia is a political tinderbox and I would say it&#39;s simply increasingly unsafe to be there. It is a shame.

This is the longest I&rsquo;ve lived anywhere in the world other than America. I lived in Tbilisi, though, this is obvious if you know what living in these sorts of countries are like. Many countries are just a city with a country attached. <br><br>Georgia had cheap medical care, but unhealthy enough food and drink that I found myself needing it often. Georgia was cheap in general, at least by the standards of the Black Sea, at least when not considering anything imported, but got more expensive and more xenophobic as Russians flooded in to dodge the draft &ndash; we moved there a month before Putin declared his war. <br><br>We had moved there because it was the one place both me and my wife could get a 1-year-long infinite-renewable visa-waiver just by showing up. When your visa is running out, you can just visit somewhere else for a few days &ndash; I traveled often enough, naturally, that I always found a reason to be out of Georgia for a few days long before the time limit was up. <br><br>Georgia is a run-down little ex-Soviet place, but to a degree, that is its charm. <br><br>Georgians are incredibly aggressive, often violent, often stupid, and generally exist in a sort of blind malaise. It is important to note that they had a long period of high levels of childhood lead exposure, which they eventually fixed. <br><br>Georgians are obsessed with the idea of joining the EU, which will never happen for them, for like 12 different incredibly obvious answers. They mostly want to join the EU because they believe that it is the club for white countries and they want proof that they are a white country. <br><br>If you tell them that they&rsquo;re not going to join the EU, they&rsquo;ll threaten to rape your wife and mother. <br><br>Still, it&rsquo;s an incredibly beautiful country, and it&rsquo;s nice to not visually stand out there, in comparison to how I come off in most cheap countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.iunetavz7pbu"><span class="c25 c39">Portugal: Husband</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My parents live here, now. When they moved to there, I still lived in Georgia &ndash; the country. They were obsessed with the idea that they were going to see me all the time, because we lived &ldquo;so close&rdquo;. I would repeatedly tell them that it wasn&rsquo;t that close. They would insist that both Georgia and Portugal were in Europe, so it&rsquo;s all close together. I would explain that the Caucasus were the southern boundary between east Europe and west Asia. They would ask why Georgia kept saying it was in Europe, then. I would explain that it was because they were very racist. We had this conversation about 5 to 9 times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">They visited me once in two years, and I visited them twice; it was unpleasant both times. I tried to visit them a third time when I was leaving Georgia for southeast Asia, and they refused to let me; I was told, a year or so later, that this was because my dad thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accept my lifestyle, and it would be a bad visit. I had just had a house fire and my cat was dead (these were unrelated; my cat died of kidney failure) and I wanted my mommy and daddy, damnit if I was 29. I visited them a fourth time, for Christmas 2024, and they convinced themselves that I had lice and worms that I&rsquo;d already been treated for (my mom tried to shave my wife to expunge her own anxieties over dead lice eggs, which my wife was so wonderful as to put up with, but that I could not abide and did not allow; she&rsquo;s been growing that out since she was 12) and did not let me into their house except one night that I got locked out, and even then I was strictly corralled into one room and left as early as possible; after flying from Portugal to Cambodia to see them, I was not allowed into their house for Christmas dinner. We ate it with her parents instead. We stayed in two separate airbnbs booked a week in advance when the trip was planned 6 months ahead of time, rather than my parents&rsquo; house. Me and my wife privately agreed to never return to Portugal after this, which I did not tell my parents about, because I do not think that they are good enough at international trip planning to bring it up on their own. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My parents would like it if I talked about how sunny Portugal is. They always tell me so. They have only ever invited me there in November and December, so to me it is just relentlessly gray and wet. I don&rsquo;t believe that my mom genuinely thinks that Portugal is sunny. Porto is 7 degrees of latitude north of LA, where she grew up. I think that she just thinks that that&rsquo;s a nice thing to say about a place. Europe is much further north than North America. People like to forget this. &ldquo;Blah blah blah Gulf Stream blah blah blah&rdquo;, fuck off. Latitude and altitude determine hours of daylight. And Porto is a dark, dark city in December. Not only is it dark, it&rsquo;s cold. In temperature, it&rsquo;s above 30 degrees Freedomheight at all times, but everything is set up to make every building and street as cold as possible, because for most of the year it is quite warm (I am told) and Europeans are generally too poor to afford air conditioning; or, I should specify, a swamp cooler costs 400 dollars in Europe for some goddamn reason and Europeans are poor. It&rsquo;s a combo effect. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My parents would like it if I talked about how cheap Portugal is. It&rsquo;s&hellip; kinda mid-range for Europe. I find it pretty expensive &ndash; it&rsquo;s certainly more expensive than most of the countries on this list. <br><br>Portugal isn&rsquo;t easy to get a visa to be in, nor is it particularly more easy than you&rsquo;d expect it to be to get to given its geographical position, nor is it a good place to start a business or invest in any way &ndash; it is absolutely choked with bureaucracy and laziness and anyone ambitious and young leaves to go do anything, anything at all, in France or Germany or the Benelux. But my parents have disagreed with me about all of those things. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At the time of this writing, my parents&rsquo; visa is currently about 6 months expired and the Portuguese government knows that it is their fault, which is why it has given them about a 6 month extension. Which is itself about to run out, but my parents assume that they&rsquo;ll just get another one. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The food is bland; they are a people that act like a strong flavor will, if it makes it into their mouth, possess them like a dark god, ancient and malevolent, and force them to ritualistically and sacrificially murder their own children as they watch on, prisoners in their own body, helpless to intervene against the bloody work of their own hands. When I ate Nepalese food there, it wasn&rsquo;t even spicy. That&rsquo;s insane. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Portugal is cobblestones and gentle hills and great public transit and has many beautiful colors and forms and etc. and so on and oh my god I cannot do this. There is no fair review I could possibly give to Portugal. My thoughts on Portugal are my thoughts on my parents. I think that if I was a different person who had been in Portugal for different reasons under different circumstances I would give a totally different review.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.c4xs1juvfm4d"><span class="c34">Portugal</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ah, Portugal, the wet dream of every digital nomad and wannabe retiree. Cultured, European, and cheap...right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Uh, maybe?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I used to fantasise about moving to Portugal and buying up land to start an intentional community there - and I was so excited when my in-laws moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It turned out that I like Portugal far less than I thought I would. This is less to do with Portugal itself and more to do with the image that I built up in my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I had imagined somewhere warm and affordable - a place where I could get away from the stifling pessimism of the UK and relax for a bit. What I actually got was a damp country that reminded me of the UK, but where my SIM card worked less well. It made me miss British food. It made me think that British food had better texture and was spicier. This is impressive, because British food is legendarily awful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Like my husband, I wish I could give Portugal a fairer review. I cannot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.k5sa68l0otrg"><span class="c25 c39">Vietnam: Wife</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We headed to Vietnam soon after leaving Georgia for good, having been told by other expats that it was cheap and amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I have to say, the food and coffee in Vietnam are the best I&#39;ve ever had. I still dream about them. Unfortunately, almost everything else sucked. We ended up moving five times in two weeks because of noise pollution, cockroaches, and being unable to breathe because Hanoi broke the world record for most polluted city while we were there. It&rsquo;s the only place where I&#39;ve ever had to wear a respirator to bed. Never again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">On the plus side, I did learn exactly how much I enjoy breathing clean air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.16cbh7ay4u4a"><span class="c34">Vietnam: Husband</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is the worst country I have ever been to. It is so bad that I no longer feel bad about America&rsquo;s involvement in the Vietnam war. The people are trying to scam you, and each other, at all times. They eat stray cats and even each other&rsquo;s pet cats if they can catch them &ndash; yes, really, look it up, they call it &ldquo;little tiger&rdquo; and they have restaurants where they serve cat meat, I not just being racist, this is a real thing &ndash; and as a consequence the country is absolutely swarmed with rats and cockroaches. Everyone always thinks that they eat cats because they&rsquo;re starving. Regionally, this is a rich country with a booming industrial sector. They&rsquo;re not starving to death. Cat is a luxury meat to them. They just like eating cat. They just like eating each other&rsquo;s cats. It&rsquo;s not a desperation thing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">When I first flew into Da Nang, we had to change hotels four times before we found one with no cockroaches in it. Not just in the lobby or the hallways, to be clear, but the rooms. Crawling on our possessions. When we finally, finally, left for Hanoi &ndash; on the theory that it might be better &ndash; it was literally the most polluted city on earth while we were there. People burned their trash in front of their houses because they didn&rsquo;t have trash collection services. Nothing had a catalytic converter on it. I think they had factories directly inside the city. Broke some sort of world record. It&rsquo;s a real shithole of a country, is what I&rsquo;m saying; this is the sort of thing not quite captured by GDP per capita figures &ndash; the things that make this place polluted are also the place that make it what a South-East Asian rice farmer would call rich. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">However, it has arguably the best coffee and food in the world, brought to you in five minutes or less, as you eat in a tiny plastic chair at a table outside and watch the world and traffic scream past you. Like much of southeast Asia &ndash; Cambodia and Thailand sadly included &ndash; eating outside always means a chance of some beggar attempting to get you to give them food while you are eating. They always seem angry when you say no. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The general vibe of Vietnam is a weird combination of tropical tranquility, the bustling of developing country traffic, the smog and speed of a country that seems desperate to stop being referred to as a developing country, the easy sleaze of a Buddhist country with little compunction about selling sex and a well-earned reputation for doing so, the trash of a place with approximately the population density of Connecticut and approximately the trash collection facilities of Vietnam; it is a teeming mass of humanity, living in filth and running scams on every stranger they meet, not so much out of malice or even genuine greed, but simply because to them Running Scams On Every Stranger They Meet is simply what you are expected to do. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Every time I crossed the street I felt like I was going to die, and I am used to crossing the street in a developing country, while you are not. Hanoi has many alleyways that never cross at right angles forming a bewildering tangle in which you will get lost among shops and houses, upscale and downscale in no apparent reason or pattern. These were perhans built originally as footpaths though since paved over &ndash; or perhaps built in the modern era, on purpose, due to lack of planning &ndash; perhaps due simply to this being Vietnam, built in a Vietnamese manner, for Vietnamese reasons, serving Vietnamese purposes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Never go here. It is beautiful and the food is great, and from abroad everything looks cheaper, but there are cheaper places that have none of these problems. I don&rsquo;t want to hear about some story you heard about a beautiful Vietnamese vacation. You don&rsquo;t know, man. You weren&rsquo;t there. <br></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.mw3256867w8e"><span class="c25 c39">Thailand: Husband </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Thailand is wonderful. Great great food, legal weed, I love the general aesthetic, visiting Wat Arun was a genuine spiritual experience &ndash; go early in the morning, alone, the people are nice, it&rsquo;s seemed safe except for the traffic accidents. Sometimes the streets are kind of dirty. During dry season it&rsquo;s too smoggy in Bangkok, but wet season isn&rsquo;t smoggy and I love the warm rains of Bangkok as I ride in a tuk-tuk along a kaleidoscope of humanity. It&rsquo;s a city of like 10 million though, so sometimes the very cheap rideshares (like a couple of dollars at most) get stuck in traffic. There&rsquo;s also some trains that go over or under traffic, but there&rsquo;s literally like two train lines. Look, it is what it is. It&rsquo;s genuinely one of my favorite cities. Not in any sort of exceptional way, except for the food &ndash; which is perhaps a bit too sweet &ndash; but it does everything that I want a city of 10 million to do for me. Good cheap easy medical care. Were visas here easier, I&rsquo;d probably live in Thailand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Your rent will be as low as $400 for the month that the visa here lasts. I recommend Sitara Place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Thailand reveals itself not through anything straightforward about it &ndash; it&rsquo;s a tropical developing country with a mild version of every stereotype that a reasonably non-racist person might have about it &ndash; but through comparisons. In comparison to Cambodia it feels orderly and clean-streeted and smoggy and lacking in stray animals on the street and generally requiring far less mental adaptation to navigate through &ndash; in comparison to Vietnam it is honest and clean-aired &ndash; in comparison to most countries it is welcoming of tourists and has easily-accessible infrastructure for doing almost anything you might want to do. It is, basically, the neutral option of tropical developing countries. If you go to Thailand, you are almost certain to have a good time but will be unable to feel as though you&rsquo;ve had an adventure &ndash; it does nothing exceptionally well beyond medical tourism and nothing exceptionally poorly beyond smog. You will walk on the beach at Pattya amongst the palms and look out at the vast sea and it will feel exactly like you would imagine that to feel. There is nothing in Thailand that is terribly surprising. Trying to review it is like trying to review the concept of a hamburger. Of course I love it. But could I write a love poem to it? I think not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.ilhykcq5cll2"><span class="c34">Thailand: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We moved to Bangkok in a horrible hurry - we were just trying to get the first flight out of Hanoi and to somewhere with less shitty air. We&#39;d both heard of Bangkok as some kind of weird paradise. It&#39;s not quite there, but it&#39;s close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I grew up in London, one of the great global cities of the world, and it made me picky about cities forever. Bangkok makes me feel right at home with its cosmopolitan atmosphere. There&#39;s always something going on, something new to do or see or eat. Wet season is glorious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There are two very good parks in Bangkok that I enjoy - Lumphini Park and Benchakitti Park. Most of my memories of Benchakitti Park are of trying to go on a walk through there and getting caught in one of those wonderful-but-also-chaotic rain storms that soak you through to the skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lumphini Park is probably my second favourite place in Bangkok. You&rsquo;re surrounded by lush lawns and beautiful blooming plants while the gleaming skyscrapers of the city rise up around you. The local cats loll around lazily and wait for you to pet them or bring them food. The local water monitors - lizards the size of dogs - don&rsquo;t want you to pet them, but they do probably want food and are quite happy to have their photos taken. (Just don&rsquo;t pet them. One tried to bite my husband.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My favourite place in Bangkok is Wat Arun - the Temple of Dawn. Go very early in the morning, as the city is just starting to rise. See the sunlight glint fiercely off the porcelain tiles. Pet the cats that make their home in the temple. Respect this place of worship and find tranquility in one of the most gloriously chaotic cities in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.nmetj9fxacpj"><span class="c25 c39">Cambodia: Husband </span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Cambodia is the country that I recommend as a starting place for all digital nomads. <br><br>You can go there for&hellip;indefinitely, and the visa costs less than $400 per year. It&rsquo;s very easy to get. The food is basically Thai food but without the sugar, and the culture isn&rsquo;t terribly different from Thai culture, either. Rent and services are cheaper than in Thailand, but goods are more expensive. My rent was $175 a month &ndash; the Hideout in Kampot, the best landlord I ever had. Canadian guy. I spent more on food than on rent. I lived there for 7 months, and found it intensely peaceful and relaxing. It was a good place to get some work done, I found the country beautiful, I very much enjoyed the people and their honest nature, and generally I found it pleasant but a bit dull. <br><br>I remember one time that I accidentally overpaid a Cambodian man by a dollar &ndash; they use American currency there as readily as the Khmer Real &ndash; and he gave it back. I tried to tell him most people would have just kept it &ndash; the Cambodian GDP per capita works out to just under $6.68 a day &ndash; but he seemed confused by the idea. &ldquo;But I already have all the money that I have,&rdquo; he said, in badly broken English. He wasn&rsquo;t offended by my idea or anything &ndash; he was just confused. The idea of keeping the dollar was simply not one that naturally occurred to him as a thing that a person </span><span class="c14">could</span><span>&nbsp;do &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t stupid, either. I found myself awkwardly explaining it to him, and he did appear to get it. It&rsquo;s just that no one had ever told him that this was a thing that he </span><span class="c14">could</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;do, before. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The beautiful thing about Cambodia is that rule of law, bureaucracy, and state capacity is about as limited there as you can get outside of an outright state of civil war. I never started a business there or did anything to truly advertise my wealth. But I was repeatedly told that if I did such a thing, I would find myself having to bribe every single local policeman and taxman. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.9zp408k0bg8y"><span class="c34">Cambodia: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We went to Cambodia on a visa run, thinking that we&#39;d just go to Angkor Wat, do a visa run, and come back to Thailand. We ended up staying for nine months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cambodia has a horrible reputation as being dirty and seedy and full of the very worst kinds of sex tourism. It&#39;s actually one of the most peaceful and laid-back countries I&#39;ve ever been to. Things are just terrifically easy to do - like Georgia, comparatively little bureaucracy is involved in anything. The people are also largely laid-back and just generally kind. Angkor Wat is not the best thing in Cambodia - the people and culture are. There&#39;s also a bizarrely good international food scene, with foreigners from all over the world coming to live and work in the country, and some very cool wildlife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The two real drawbacks are the lack of good health care compared with Vietnam or Thailand, and the fact that you can do literally anything with enough money and connections. Still, Cambodia has a special place in my heart because of the atmosphere and people. I&#39;m so glad to be going back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.r3we71da3fg0"><span class="c25 c39">Turkey: Husband</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Turkey (I&rsquo;m not calling it what Erdogan wants. Fuck him. And his new spelling is motivated by a 3rd world mindset misunderstanding of English and would be pronounced EXACTLY LIKE TURKEY IS by most native English speakers) is the 2nd worst country I&rsquo;ve ever been to. Well. Istanbul is. It&rsquo;s clogged with traffic, it&rsquo;s dirty, I had to fistfight an Uber driver who tried to rob me and my wife, all the shopkeepers yell at you as you pass their shops, the prices are essentially random because their currency is so chaotic, they don&rsquo;t reliably have western toilets, the food isn&rsquo;t even THAT good, the city&rsquo;s skyline is maddeningly flat and city-filled &ndash; there&rsquo;s neither mountains nor forest nor skyscrapers from any height, and something about this simply causes me panic &ndash; there&rsquo;s so many mosques that at one point I could see 5 of them while standing in one place, and it somehow speaks the least English out of every country on this list. <br><br>I have never been to parts of Turkey that aren&rsquo;t Istanbul. For all I know they are perfectly nice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.v3jvo7ejxvv3"><span class="c34">Turkey: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>In contrast to Cambodia, Turkey - at least Istanbul - is </span><span class="c14">not</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;calm at all. Istanbul is a crazy, chaotic place full of tourists and people trying to buy more stable dollars or euros against the Turkish lira, which is doing&hellip;lira things. Nothing good. It&rsquo;s also the only place where I&rsquo;ve ever seen a fistfight over $3 take place (that was the Uber driver who tried to rob me and my husband). Never again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The cats are very sweet, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.3xzo2yovn1se"><span class="c25 c39">Sweden: Husband</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sweden is like if the Midwest was beautiful. I enjoyed the food &ndash; moose, low-alcohol beer, lots of fish, pleasingly rich coffee, etc etc &ndash; and found the society to be well-ordered. The public transit worked well, and the buildings are warm. Because Sweden is so adapted to the cold, I felt warmer there in winter than I did in Cyprus. It is a place of beautiful nature and beautiful architecture. Despite the cost of living, I do sometimes consider buying a house there. There&rsquo;s just a wonderful aesthetic to it. I was only there for a week and only in Stockholm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.3kea8pkcpcab"><span class="c34">Sweden: Wife</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sweden is perhaps the most aggressively pleasant country I&#39;ve been to. While visiting friends, we arrived horribly late at night. The trains from the airport were still running in the small hours, and walking from the station to our aparthotel, soft warm lights were prettily strung up everywhere. Our friends&#39; nice new apartment was beautifully insulated. Things just worked, everywhere we looked. It was such a relief. Yes, food could be expensive, but you could walk or take public transit basically everywhere and come back to a warm, toasty apartment and a comfy bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My overwhelming impression is that Sweden is a cosy, functional country. I can&#39;t wait to come back. Go Sweden!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.29l0vht1ob1c"><span class="c25 c39">Japan: Wife</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I went here with my husband for his thirtieth birthday. We have both wanted to go to Japan for years. We made many jokes about things being &ldquo;just like in our Japanese animes&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">They are not. They are quite possibly even better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We spent most of our time in Tokyo, a city we had both very much looked forward to visiting for years. Visiting Tokyo is like visiting several different cities, all of which are smooshed into one big megacity called Tokyo and connected by a train system that plays happy little tunes whenever you call at a station. (Seriously. I loved those tunes. I loved the Tokyo Metro.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">What unites all of the mini-cities within Tokyo is that they&rsquo;re bizarrely clean and quiet for a settlement of this size. I grew up in London, I&rsquo;ve visited Paris, I&rsquo;ve lived in Bangkok - Tokyo is by far the most orderly. It was actually quite unsettling to me. Tokyo is also quite grey; by the time I had spent my first week there, I was &ldquo;revenge dressing&rdquo; in bright colours and fixing my long, brown hair in place with gaudy hairpins just to make sure I got some colour in my day. On the plus side, the food is of course incredible. Everything from high-end meals to food out of a vending machine tasted wonderful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We also rode the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto and back. Watching Japan streak by me at 200 mph has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl, and it did not disappoint. More than that - Kyoto is the most peaceful place I have ever visited. I felt such an overwhelming sense of calm there, surrounded by hills and mountains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My husband and I are thinking of moving to Japan. I can&rsquo;t wait to explore more of the country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.qvx0cj6w7gpz"><span class="c34">Japan: Husband</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>I have spent exactly two weeks in Japan (in Tokyo and Kyoto) and I would quite like to go back. <br><br>I feel like a bit of a basic bro for being a white guy who loves Japan. But you know what? It&rsquo;s actually great. Tokyo is a city with zero trash on the streets, and it&rsquo;s so smog-free that it actually smells </span><span class="c14">good</span><span class="c3">. The food is amazing, the general vibe is great, I would enjoy simply wandering around and existing in Japan. It was a fantastic time. I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. You&rsquo;ve seen travel reviews of Japan. It is exactly like the travel reviews. It lives up to the hype. It&rsquo;s a fantastic place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;m not even a weeb or anything. It&rsquo;s just great. It is exactly as has been advertised to you. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c40 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.m6wsbiyeimul"><span class="c25 c39">Our Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As we finish writing this, we&rsquo;ve been coming to terms with some bad health news that means we need to settle down in one place for a bit. Travelling from country to country is a massive privilege, but it also means forgoing a proper kitchen and a real exercise routine and consistent medical care and all the other things that catch up with you as you turn thirty.<br><br>The thing to consider, though, is that you might be preserving your body &ndash; you might be scrimping and saving and etc &ndash; all for nothing. You might get hit by a bus tomorrow. You might live to 100. You should probably do things that make sense with either. Working a job so you can rent an apartment so you can work a job isn&rsquo;t a great use of your time. I&rsquo;m not saying that seeing the world is the only thing worth doing, but I am saying that the only things worth doing are things that you think are worth doing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I was thinking about the conclusion I want to write for this - the takeaway that I want readers to have. It&rsquo;s hard because something as big as moving countries regularly feels like it shouldn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c14">have</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a conclusion. I don&rsquo;t want to stop travelling. I&rsquo;m not done learning.<br><br>It is crazy for there to be an entire world and for you to only see one part of it. That is a weird thing to do. You are given so many options and so little time, and you spend your time on just one of them. Why are you doing this to yourself? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But if there were anything - one thing - I had to say, I&rsquo;d say this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There&rsquo;s a world beyond the Bay Area. Beyond the US even. It&rsquo;s big and deeply weird and sometimes unpleasant but it&rsquo;s always, </span><span class="c14">always</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;interesting and it reminds you that the map is not the territory. Frankly, the territory is not the territory, either. I can go to all these countries and still not really know most of them. This is what is addictive about travel &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t mean addictive in a cute way; I mean addictive &ndash; that you are always intoxicated by the thought of going somewhere deeper, weirder, wilder. That there are always more places to go than there is time in a human life. </span></p><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.pp07ap1cziqy"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.2c2vsflhr3kt"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 441.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image81.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 441.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c24">Dall-e 2 and 3 as Depicters of Human Life</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span>Scott Alexander found in his AI art Turing test that most people had scant ability to tell whether an image was produced by AI or by a human artist, and that on average people showed a slight preference for AI art.

It looks and feels so much like what we are wired to like that we consume it &mdash; but then it destroys some of our innards.. </span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c33 c42 c69">My experiments with AI art produced, among other things, a collection of images Dall-e 2 and Dall-e 3 made when I prompted them with lines from love songs or brief summaries of songs&rsquo; lyrics. I&rsquo;ll be using them here, paired, in my review of both Dall-e versions as depicters of human situations and human emotion. My focus will be on what you might call the images&rsquo; integrity. &nbsp;Are their subjects&rsquo; emotions and actions painted on, like the ancientness and Egyptianness and ornamentedness of Ancient Gate? Or do we experience them as more richly real? Are they appealing but toxic, like antifreeze, or do they nourish and enrich the viewer in the way that leads people to call things art?</span></p><p class="c96 c55"><span class="c33 c69 c42">My big picture take on AI is that its impact on individuals is getting worse and worse. But here in this review let&rsquo;s reverse the flow of time, so that we&rsquo;ll have a happy AI ending for once. Let&rsquo;s start with some AI suckage.</span></p><p class="c96 c55 c21"><span class="c33 c69 c42"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.o6u6kkwgehbx"><span class="c25 c39">Barbie</span></h2><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c42">When I gave Dall-e 3 ten love song prompts it made bright, spiffy pictures.

The AI could flesh out any of these prompts in thousands of ways. Think of the possibilities for fleshing out, say, #4, a woman telling a man to take another little piece of her heart. She could be talking to him on an avocado green phone, dressed in nothing but one of his big shirts, crying and blowing her nose on the shirttail. She could be driving by his house in a white Chrysler Le Baron hurling a hunk of cow&rsquo;s heart at his front door. She could be magically merging with him, breastbone to breastbone. But Dall-e 3 just shows us a woman handing a man an entire cardioid heart. We get a very simple illustration, with one element &ndash; the cardioid heart &ndash; &nbsp;that&rsquo;s not merely simple but actually schematic. In fact we are getting something doubly simple. The partially diagrammatic image illustrates not the actual prompt but a simplified version it, one lacking the detail that the woman has already given the man one piece her heart, and is now offering to give him another. At first glance the image looks full of detail lushly rendered &mdash; and the fabric folds, the highlights, and of course the woman herself are indeed lush eye candy. In fact, though, the image is an impoverished take in fancy dress.</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c33 c69 c42">You can say the same about #2, which illustrates some lyrics from &ldquo;Lola.&rdquo; Dall-e 3 gives us what you might call the limiting case of a simple, literal instantiation of a prompt: It puts the actual words of the prompt in the image with a crowd below the words, all presumably celebrating whatever it is the words mean. But as for visuals of what the words actually convey about gender and crushes and lust &mdash; nada. Where&rsquo;s the gender-bending? Where&rsquo;s sex? Where&rsquo;s Lola? All of them are hidden behind rainbow drapery. Oh, to see a vast miniskirted queen roller blade through at 30 mph and knock over Mr and Mrs. Straights-Love-Rainbows like bowling pins!</span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c33 c69 c42"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c42 c14">The</span><span class="c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c33 c42 c14 c107">people are either emotionally flat or wearing selfie grins</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c42">Most of the prompts describe situations where you would expect to see faces full of feeling. But there is very little emotion on the faces in these images. There&rsquo;s no fascination, no yearning, no lust, no ecstasy, no distain, no fear, no anger, no sorrow. In fact most of the faces show almost no emotion. The central couple in #2 is unpleasantly stoney-faced, and the faces in #4, # 5 and #9 are just a shade away from blank. (The woman in #4 might be saying, &ldquo;you want another piece of my heart? Here, take the whole thing. Whatever.&rdquo;). The women in #9 &amp; 10 are essentially makeup models striking a pose, and the men behind them are staring blankly into space. Is there joy on any faces in the bunch? Yes, some. There&rsquo;s the beige young couple in #3. And if you&rsquo;re not squeamish you can count as joy the plastiform glee of the steampunk couple in #6-8 that, over the course of 3 images, intensities into a sort of pop-eyed carnivorous ecstasy. Personally, I experience the looks on their faces not as joy but as over-the-top selfie grins (&ldquo;here&rsquo;s us having an </span><span class="c42 c14">awesome </span><span class="c33 c69 c42">time!&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c33 c69 c42">There is also lots and lots of hearty, healthy cheerfulness on display in #1. But that illustration represents a grave misunderstanding of the prompt.</span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c33 c69 c42"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c42 c14 c107">The worlds are hyper-conventional.</span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c42">Regarding any activity or trait that&rsquo;s judgable, these images are way far up at the &ldquo;good&rdquo; end of the judgment spectrum.

Look, for instance, at #6 - 8, which show the variety of images Dall-e 2 came up with for a single prompt. (And note the lack of variety in the corresponding Dall-e 3 images.). </span><span class="c42 c14">Emotionally flat faces? </span><span class="c42">Are you kidding? This batch shows us eager hopeless hope, an affectionate grin, solitary despair, angry stubborn determination, alarm, veiled homicidal rage and horny blowsy cynicism. </span><span class="c42 c14">Hyper-conventional niceness? </span><span class="c42">Hahaha.</span><span class="c42 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c33 c69 c42">There is not one flawless youthful beauty in the bunch, and the people and settings have a layer of dark smudge that suggests dirt and wear. We see quite a bit of transgressive behavior&mdash; self-injury, sex in public, sexual assault, recklessness. And did you catch the raunchy grin on the nipple-fondling guy in #8, who is clearly saying to you &ldquo;hey, wanna watch?&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c96 c55"><span class="c62 c53">Dall-e 2 took me to many odd places, but only a minority seemed random and incoherent, and even the worst of those were entertaining. And the best ones? They shot a spiraling quirky arrow straight through the heart of the matter. Look, for instance, at the sorrowful, earnest, goofy hope on the face in #1, with its big smudged eyes and squiggly smile. Dall-e 2 absolutely nailed ever-hopeful unrequited love with that face. And the other features of the image are not just consistent with that vision of the situation, they intensify and enrich the viewer&rsquo;s experience of it. Placing the face on a ball, rather than on a person with a ball, captures the speaker&rsquo;s helplessness and lack of dignity. Having the face looking straight out, rather than at its beloved, cranks up the intensity &ndash; the viewer is the position of the beloved. The almost blank background inflicts on the viewer the absence of any other hope or goal in the yearner&rsquo;s life. And the ball&rsquo;s wear and smudges tell us the hopeless hope has been going on for a long time.</span></p><p class="c55 c96"><span class="c62 c53">Dall-e 2 does something similar in both of its illustrations of Ruby (#9 and #10), another song about a heartbroken lover, this one full of rage. &nbsp;The speaker is a partly paralyzed Vietnam veteran whose wife has taken to going into town to meet men. All Dall had to work with for this image was a brief description of the people and setting. Yet notice how it captures the woman&rsquo;s blowsiness via her clothing, facial expression and the bitter cynical look on her face; and all that right next to the man&rsquo;s posture of angry discouragement. Notice the row of lock fittings on one of the trailer doors in #9. Even the error Dall-e 2 made &mdash; putting Ruby rather than the man in a wheelchair &mdash; has truth to it. The man is thinking about putting her in the ground with his gun. And she seems to know that: Look at her slit-eyed, uneasy glance over her shoulder at him in #9.</span></p><p class="c96 c55"><span class="c42 c111">Illustration #7 of a variant of &ldquo;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&rdquo; is my favorite of the bunch. I think of this pair as the Asperger&rsquo;s couple. Details in the image tell us they are both armored, deeply private people. The man appears to be wearing a mask, the woman wears a stiff, armor-like bodice below her bust and has no eyes. Despite their stiffness and their armor, though, they each manage to signal their interest. The man is wearing what appears to be a metal </span><span class="c42 c9 c70 c128">boutonniere</span><span class="c62 c53">; the woman&rsquo;s breasts project softly above the top of her bodice, and though she is eyeless there is a large camera lens looking out of her hat. Even Dall-e&rsquo;s anatomical error &mdash; the man&rsquo;s impossibly long thumb and forefinger, crooked impossibly into a heart shape &mdash; seems accurately expressive of a deeper truth. It is as though that part of the image is showing us that in declaring his love he has managed the impossible. &nbsp;He declared it in a stiff, weird, awkward way, but he did it.</span></p><p class="c96 c55"><span class="c62 c53">And look at Dall-e 2&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lola.&rdquo; It puts front and center the thing that&rsquo;s front and center in the song, and that Dall-e 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lola&rdquo; image avoids &mdash; sex, here represented quite graphically by a hand groping some sexually ambiguous genitals. And the rest of the image plays cleverly with paired opposites and in-betweens. A central disk shaded from light gray to dark gray is a graphical display of in-betweenness, and it is surrounded by opposites and in-betweens of many kinds: A shapely leg, but one placed more like a phallus than a leg; matching pairs of black legs, one in front of one side of the disk, one behind the other; knock knees next to a pair of more open thighs; male and female symbols with some elements missing and others switched around; one weird profile talking about 2 genders, another facing in the opposite direction, mouth open but saying nothing at all. These visual elements have quite a different character from the ancientness, Egyptianness, etc. that Scott&rsquo;s friend complained were painted on. They have a logic to them. They are visual analogs of what the song is about &mdash; sexual opposites, sexual swaps, sexual in-betweens.</span></p><p class="c96 c55 c21"><span class="c62 c53"></span></p><h2 class="c45 c70" id="h.mhx9zlb51qf9"><span class="c25 c39">Antifreeze</span></h2><p class="c1 c70"><span class="c42 c105">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c62 c53">AI learns in a way that defies our intuition that knowledge grows from the inside out. We feel that before a mind can grasp complex things it must first place them in an inner structure of categories, hierarchies, valences, regularities, similarities, etc. But AI just sucks up everything ever said about anything and memorizes the patterns and meta-patterns in that material, and now it can produce streams of words that carry more information about more things than even a present-day Leonardo da Vinci could know. There was an outside-to-inside process that produced, if not a mind furnished with knowledge, then something that&rsquo;s a reasonable stand-in for it. </span></p><p class="c1 c70"><span class="c62 c53">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet despite its capacity to tell us things that improve and enrich the mental structure that is our understanding, AI itself stores its information in a form that lacks much of the structure that our storage has. It does not, for instance, rank things on desirability, because it lacks goals, tastes, emotions, drives and ethics (at least home-grown versions of these). Its cross-referencing across domains is pretty limited. For example, GPT once recommended to me an obviously useless floor cleaning mixture commonly recommended online, vinegar plus baking soda. Yet I know that if I had asked it in another context what that mixture&rsquo;s reaction products are it would have known, and would also have known that these products can&rsquo;t clean floors. &nbsp;I doubt that AI could produce on original analogy. &nbsp;Could an AI, for instance, compare a total immersion language course to drinking from a fire hose if it had never encountered in its training data an analogy using a fire hose to represent overwhelming information flow? And AI is very limited in its capacity to describe and explain itself. For example, I read that when learning to recognize some eye disease in retinal images AI also became able to tell the gender of each subject but it &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t now how it knew&rdquo; the gender.</span></p><p class="c1 c70"><span class="c62 c53">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasoning about the failings of Dall-e 3 in the context of these characteristics of AI tempts me to think that Dall-e 3 fails to produce rich and interesting images of romance because of the deficits I just pointed out in the structure of what AI &ldquo;knows.&rdquo; &nbsp;Its information about the relevant topics is not sorted and linked and layered in ways that permit the sort of deep processing that might produce a rich and striking image, something unexpected that yet rings true. It is especially hobbled in handling information about emotion-laden human situations. People vary quite a lot in how they rank the desirability of the various details of such situations. &nbsp;Consequently, fine judgment calls are required to produce images of human situations that are not cliches but that viewers find acceptable, images that have some novelty and funkiness but not so much that people find them grotesque and meaningless. &nbsp;Rather than attempt judgment calls of a kind it&rsquo;s not equipped for, Dall-e 3 &nbsp;seems to have relied on a pretty simple algorithm in choosing what to put in its images: Avoid novelty; show what is prototypical and popular. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c42 c111">If the goal is to please the viewer, Dall-e 3&rsquo;s strategy is probably the best choice for a creator with such limited mastery of the relevant data. &nbsp;Sights that lack novelty aren&rsquo;t as blah for viewers as one might think. &nbsp;F</span><span class="c62 c53 c70">aces, for instance, are judged beautiful to the extent their proportions conform to the averaged ones of the population. &nbsp;Emotions and human interactions tend to evoke strong judgments, many of them negative, from viewers to the extent that they diverge from the typical. Dall-e 3 sticks with the safe course of showing mostly positive emotions or none at all, and familiar behaviors. &nbsp;Then it lays on the guaranteed crowd-pleasers, such as lushly detailed clothing and settings, image sharpness and high color saturation.</span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c62 c53">Dall-e 3&rsquo;s algorithm produces images of human situations and emotions that immediately strike the viewer as looking great, but that lack what you might call &ldquo;insideness.&rdquo; The lack it because they lack most of the clues that allow us to form models of how other people work and how they feel. &nbsp;The deviations from the desirable, prototypical and average that Dall-e 3 avoids are in fact the best clues images offer to what the people in them are like and what they are thinking and feeling. You could say that Dall-e 3 has made people in its own image: &nbsp;They are built &nbsp;from the outside in, and do not seem to have insides of the kind we do. If Dall-e 3&rsquo;s images are antifreeze &mdash; i.e., appealing but toxic &mdash; it is the deficit in insideness that makes them toxic. </span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c62 c53">Are images deficient in insideness so bad? Probably not, unless you worry, as I do, that things in human life are gradually losing their insideness as technology progresses. Not that long ago there were many items in daily life whose logic and inner workings were self-evident &mdash;ploughs, ice boxes, wagons. But over the last couple hundred years fewer and fewer of the objects in our lives have knowable interiors. Most people now have very little understanding of how their familiar possessions &ndash; their phones, their cars, their microwaves &ndash; actually work. &nbsp;While there is an interior under their shiny exteriors, for most of us they might as well have no inner parts or inner workings, but run on magic. Somewhere in the back of our minds there must be a disturbing awareness that we are vulnerable in a way earlier generations weren&rsquo;t, because we have no picture of the inner workings of many things we use routinely. &nbsp; If all of these items were destroyed, most of us would have absolutely no idea how to replace them. And couldn&rsquo;t it be that evolution optimized us for a life where we make things, then live among these things we understand and can reproduce?</span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c42">And then there&rsquo;s the shrinking insideness of the people in our lives. Starting around the time television became popular people have been hanging out less and less with other people &nbsp;and more and more with virtual representations of them. &nbsp;But plenty has already been written about that, and I won&rsquo;t repeat it. Instead, here&rsquo;s a loss-of-insideness story from a friend who also broods about insideness drain.</span><span class="c42 c144">&nbsp;</span><span class="c53 c69 c129 c145">He has a lot of small children in his extended family, and often sees the whole bunch at family gatherings. Until recently, the kids reacted to happy surprises with loud excitement, each expressing the feeling in his or her own way. But now they cry &ldquo;yay!&rdquo; in unison. &ldquo;They saw that on television,&rdquo; he mutters. &ldquo;Now they think that&rsquo;s how kids act when they hear good news. It&rsquo;s creepy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c42 c111">And yet, despite all of AI&rsquo;s deficits, and the way they seem to explain why Dall-e 3 cannot produce deeply interesting and entertaining images of people in love, Dall-e 2 managed to do it. &nbsp;How? &nbsp;Did my prompts lead it to the full lyrics, so that it had very rich prompts to work with? (But then why didn&rsquo;t the prompts take Dall-e 3 to them too?) &nbsp;Did it use images from album covers for guidance? (But would it have &ldquo;known&rdquo; to look at covers of albums the songs appeared in, or at related albums?). Were there more Deviant Art-type images and fewer advertising image in Dall-e 2&rsquo;s training set, giving it a larger storehouse of unusual-but-valid images as sources? Does the difference all come down to Dall-e 2&rsquo;s being far less constrained by developer-implanted rules to avoid depicting things that are not &ldquo;nice&rdquo;? And how on earth could this not very advanced text-to-image generator have carried out the depth of processing required to produce Image #4, given the prompt &ldquo;take another little piece of my heart&rdquo;? How did it know to make the face not just sad-selfie sad, but </span><span class="c42 c14 c111">bleak</span><span class="c62 c53">? What gave it enough grasp of emotions and of physical analogs of mental states to show blank nothing, rather than a wound, under the central hole in the woman&rsquo;s dress, and then to scatter over the dress black spots that sometimes look like bullet holes and sometimes like black roses in the print on the dress&rsquo;s cloth and sometimes like both? I would love to hear readers&rsquo; ideas about how little Dall-e 2 managed to pull off images like the ones I&rsquo;ve shown.</span></p><p class="c0 c70"><span class="c62 c53"></span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c62 c53">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c55"><span class="c62 c53"></span></p><p class="c1 c55"><span class="c62 c53">Dall-e 2&rsquo;s site is still up, but it is no longer possible to make images with it.

I mean, that&rsquo;s a lot of brimstone to &nbsp;have delivered, but even if you solve that, what are you going to do for fire? Hell really revolves around fire. Remember though, you don&rsquo;t really need a lot of fuel at the start of things. No, if you want the world to burn, mostly you just need Tinder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Let&rsquo;s talk about dating apps[1].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There&rsquo;s no real need to go into a long history of dating apps here like I might if I were reviewing something else, partly because the basic idea pre-dates the Internet anyway. Match.com debuted in 1995, only a few years into the existence of the public Internet, and what preceded it was just an analog version of the same idea: people making profiles of themselves and exchanging them with other users in the hopes of finding a match. This makes sense, of course, because love and sex are among the most baseline human desires, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see how advances in digital connection could improve the ability to find them. It didn&rsquo;t take a spark of genius to say &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put dating profiles online instead of mailing out packets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For a long time, online dating remained just a digital version of that analog system. Even into the late 2000s, the majority of dating sites still involved making a large, detailed profile and then browsing freely through many other profiles, sending a message, and hoping for the best. There was no barrier of needing to match first, and because you could see each person&rsquo;s profile whenever you wanted, you weren&rsquo;t under a huge time constraint to read it quickly in order to see the next one. I personally thought this system was at least marginally better than what&rsquo;s replaced it, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter; I think thylacines were pretty cool too, and the old dating site style is no less extinct than they are. Regardless, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t without many of the same issues, and it wasn&rsquo;t well positioned to compete with what came after.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">What&rsquo;s important is what has changed. The modern dating app as we know it really started with the advent of the matching mechanic: seeing one profile at a time, having to decide whether to like or reject said profile, and having to both like the other before messaging is even possible. That&rsquo;s the unifying, ubiquitous feature that defines them still. Tinder introduced this in 2012, and it has completely taken over the space since. All of the major apps work this way, regardless of how they dress it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We&rsquo;re deep in the age of the dating app now, with the old-style dating sites fully gone &ndash; the few late survivors having been bought out and turned into apps &ndash; and a higher percentage of people than ever using them. So do they work? Are they worth using? The title of this review doesn&rsquo;t leave a lot of doubt about my conclusion, but let&rsquo;s see what the data says[2].</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.ek0rbnrsx3b7"><span class="c25 c39">The Individual Apps</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If this were a different product, this would be where I&rsquo;d go through and review the major players and their different pros and cons, but there&rsquo;s not any real point in doing so here because there aren&rsquo;t actually that many major players. The Match Group essentially owns the entire heterosexual-dating-app industry. This sounds like an exaggeration, but here&rsquo;s a list of major apps they own:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_z1ahnpfdzedq-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Tinder</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Hinge</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Plenty of Fish</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://match.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170391003&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kwekYNI3FXuJjqrKbi46I">Match.com</a></span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">OKCupid</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Most if not all of the &ldquo;XPeopleMeet&rdquo; apps</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There are a few other competitors, Bumble being the largest (they also own Badoo, which is fairly popular outside of the US), but even the ones not owned by Match tend to be strikingly similar in design. They all use the swipe-based matching system (some have you press a like or dislike button instead of literally swiping, but the result is identical). They almost all focus on short profiles with very brief prompts. And they all lock the basic functionality of the app behind paywalls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Their brand-specialized differences don&rsquo;t offer a lot of bright spots either. OKCupid&rsquo;s matching algorithm, once the defining feature of the site, is now largely indistinguishable from what every other app is doing, and its entire approach struggles without the ability to browse profiles freely, rather than having to swipe constantly. Bumble&rsquo;s purported reason for existence, that women would message first, met the unfortunate reality that women largely don&rsquo;t seem to actually do so given the option, and that feature has been effectively reworked &ndash; women can still message first, but they can also just allow men to message them first. Hinge&rsquo;s identifying feature, that they are &ldquo;the app designed to be deleted&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t actually qualify as a feature at all (though I will give them credit for the slogan, because deleting it in disgust does technically match the app&rsquo;s design goal).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Some have features that are unequivocally detrimental to the experience. Hinge is a good example of this. Hinge allows messages to be sent as part of the act of liking a profile; you pick a picture or prompt from the profile to like, and then can comment on it. In theory, this might seem like it would make people more engaged in the process and give potential matches more to judge them on. But all this really does is massively increase the effort required on every profile that you like, as you now need to think of a message to send each person. Does this cut down on mindless swiping? Probably a little bit, but it also creates a larger burden for the user without actually improving their chances, since so many other people are also sending messages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bumble likewise has a 24 hour time window after a match, during which either the woman must send a message (or the man must send one if they&rsquo;ve selected that option), or the match goes away. Perhaps this is intended to create a sense of urgency and make users more likely to actually start the conversation, but it also makes it very easy for the few matches you do have to disappear before you can even do anything about them. There&rsquo;s an option to voluntarily extend it, giving your match another 24 hours to message you, but predictably, the ability to do this more than once per day is gated behind the paywall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If it feels like I&rsquo;m not giving a fair shake to each app&rsquo;s unique idea, I really can&rsquo;t stress enough how much those gimmicks are a surface-level illusion. The apps function almost identically across the board. They&rsquo;re just putting different labels on the same bottle of terrible wine to make people feel more like they&rsquo;re getting something tailored to them. But open up and drink it, and the swill is all the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The massively increased quantity of apps doesn&rsquo;t help the situation either. Instead, it just fractures the population, splitting everyone up onto a bunch of different apps that are all interchangeable, while limiting the amount of people any user is likely to see. For the really small, specialty apps, this is especially terrible, as anyone living outside of a big city will run out of potential matches very quickly. Even if one of those smaller apps had an innovation that was genuinely good, the small size of their user base would make its value negligible.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.4alete1cvwuy"><span class="c25 c39">The Monetization</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So obviously dating apps aren&rsquo;t free. How are they getting your money? There&rsquo;s a few ways that basically all of them use now (to a degree this may be because Match Group owns them all, but even the non-Match Group ones use them too).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The first and most ubiquitous is the subscription plan. Let&rsquo;s look at </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.hinge.co/hc/en-us/articles/38014282744595-Subscription-and-Purchase-Benefits&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170396412&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kEBVrbKkDlmpFvmk0T7jF">the Hinge plans</a></span><span class="c3">, as an example:</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 407.50px; height: 412.54px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 407.50px; height: 412.54px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">HingeX is $50 monthly, and the breakdown for Tinder features and cost for the highest tier is similar[3]. If you just want unlimited likes via Hinge+, pretty much the bare minimum you need as a male user to even be able to use the app, that runs around 30 dollars monthly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Obviously there are microtransactions on top of that. Each of them sells some form of &ldquo;superlike&rdquo;[4], a like that puts you at the front of the person&rsquo;s queue of likes, in theory making you more visible to them. These run usually around 3-5 dollars each, depending on how many you buy[5]. This probably has a marginal effect, taking your chances from less than 1% to&hellip; well, probably still less than 1%. The apps themselves make a lot of claims about how effective superlikes are at increasing your odds, but they don&rsquo;t make any of their data public, so it&rsquo;s hard not to believe that they&rsquo;re being entirely truthful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Most apps also have a &ldquo;boost&rdquo; system of some kind, something that puts you in a high-priority queue of sorts, where your profile is more likely to be seen by other users. These run about $10 an hour on most apps. This is of extremely dubious value. Women mostly aren&rsquo;t swiping very often because they&rsquo;re inundated with likes already, so as a man, you&rsquo;re not actually being seen by way more people &ndash; and even if you were, it takes a couple of seconds to see your pictures, decide they&rsquo;re not interested, and keep swiping. And for women, being seen isn&rsquo;t really the issue, it&rsquo;s filtering the likes you get already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Almost all of them now also gate the ability to filter the profiles you see behind a paywall. If you don&rsquo;t want kids, or don&rsquo;t want to date someone that doesn&rsquo;t hold your religious beliefs, or don&rsquo;t want someone who smokes, you&rsquo;re usually left with no option but to pay up, because the act of manually checking for those things each time adds a ton of extra time to the process, and swiping hundreds of times is necessary to give yourself an actual shot at matching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>All of that is pretty bad at a baseline, but for some apps, it actually gets worse. For example, Hinge has a feature called </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.hinge.co/hc/en-us/articles/360057625534-What-is-Standouts&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170399025&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lb1b9yYo-eNc7WsGH9k6s">Standouts</a></span><span class="c3">. In their words:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Standouts is a feed of profiles catching the most attention on Hinge&mdash;tailored to your preferences and recent activity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Which is to say, Standouts are the most popular people in your area who are getting the most attention. You get shown 10-15 of these a day, and many of them will never show up during your normal swiping. In theory, this is an extra pool of people you get to message&hellip;except that the only way to do so is via a Rose (their version of a superlike), which cost 4 dollars each. So you&rsquo;re spending $4 to send a message to the people who are, by the definition of the feature, already receiving tons of other messages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Somehow, this actually gets worse, because Hinge will show you profiles that are inactive for a period up to 2 years, but haven&rsquo;t been deleted yet. Which means, your odds of receiving a reply aren&rsquo;t just very low, they are indistinguishable from zero. At least you only paid $4 for the privilege of sending a message into the void, I suppose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Look, of course dating apps are going to profit somehow. It costs money to run servers and, at least in theory, these apps provide a meaningful service. They&rsquo;re allowed to make money. But even casinos and gacha games aren&rsquo;t as directly manipulative, deceitful, and exploitative as the monetization schemes of these apps. You&rsquo;d probably lose less money downloading a literal scam app than downloading one of these and trying to actually use it as intended.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.fn6eutimj4ti"><span class="c25 c39">The Dating App Experience</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So how does this actually play out? Well, the experience is radically different for men and women, so it really has to be broken out more specifically. But before I do that, let&rsquo;s look at some quick numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Men make up approximately </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ssrs.com/insights/the-public-and-online-dating-in-2024/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170401291&amp;usg=AOvVaw11OIll1KemlNjAcLk_syhu">56% of dating app users vs women&rsquo;s 39%</a></span><span>, with the numbers more skewed for some than others. Tinder&rsquo;s ratio is 75-25, but the situation is even more bleak than that sounds. One person attempted to </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170401609&amp;usg=AOvVaw1aLvvxw2FiuT-aNTi6zVXu">hash out the inequality through their own experiment</a></span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. The Gini coefficient for the Tinder economy based on &ldquo;like&rdquo; percentages was calculated to be 0.58. This means that the Tinder economy has more inequality than 95.1% of all the world&rsquo;s national economies. In addition, it was determined that a man of average attractiveness would be &ldquo;liked&rdquo; by approximately 0.87% (1 in 115) of women on Tinder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Now, is Tinder particularly bad? Of course. But things look similarly grim elsewhere also. Per a study done by </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/yourlooksandyourinbox.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170402447&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zSru0J0ipYHp05Oghi4fB">the OKCupid blog</a></span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; from back in a time when dating sites were willing to actually talk about their data &ndash; women rate </span><span class="c8">80%</span><span>&nbsp;of men as &ldquo;below average&rdquo; in terms of attractiveness. Men by and large also tend to have the unfortunate habit of liking </span><span class="c14">everyone</span><span>, which beyond being extremely inefficient, actually makes their own situation worse; when women have 150 likes in their inbox, the chance that any single one of them actually gets a match with them goes dramatically down. But this is a classic tragedy of the commons situation, because any guy who </span><span class="c14">isn&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;swiping right on everyone is massively hurting their chances; remember, 1 in 115 women will like him, so if he&rsquo;s not swiping right on </span><span class="c14">at least</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;115, he can&rsquo;t even be surprised he hasn&rsquo;t matched with someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So here&rsquo;s how it actually feels at the ground level.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.6rkxkr43hwbo"><span class="c34">The Male Experience</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You spend a bunch of time setting up a profile and selecting pictures &ndash; most of that effort doesn&rsquo;t actually matter, of course, because your profile will be viewed by very few women, many of whom will be sorting through a mass of likes and don&rsquo;t have much time to give you. Your first picture probably accounts for &gt;50% of your likelihood of getting a match. Still, you try to get the best pictures you have, get your friends to take some good ones, and spend a lot of time agonizing over what to say to each prompt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You then start swiping and&ndash; oops, you ran out of swipes. Well, if you&rsquo;re going to be on a dating app, you should take it seriously, right? So you pay up $50 for a month of premium, get unlimited swipes, and get to see your likes. Then you swipe right on a ton of profiles, probably almost all of them that you see &ndash; even if you&rsquo;re selective and don&rsquo;t swipe on everyone by default, the apps show you the most attractive people first, so you&rsquo;re more likely to swipe right on them anyway &ndash; and then at some point, you stop and go about your normal day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If it&rsquo;s your first time doing this, you probably expect to come back later, have some matches, send some messages, and really get this thing rolling. That&rsquo;s not actually going to happen; if you&rsquo;re lucky you might have a single match, because remember, the match rate for men is less than 1%. Good news, that match wants to move the conversation to Whatsapp! Bad news, that&rsquo;s the oldest scam technique in the book. Alright, so you report the scam, then go back to swiping. I&rsquo;d love to tell you that eventually this pays off, but the evidence just doesn&rsquo;t support it. If you&rsquo;re paying for a bunch of &ldquo;superlikes&rdquo; and a premium-tier subscription plan, you go to the top of the list of each girl, at least, right? Well, at least into the same pile as every other guy who is also doing that. But more than a third of men are, and the most attractive girls are also collecting all the &ldquo;free&rdquo; superlikes that are given out to users every week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is also the point where the apps like Hinge start making &ldquo;Best Match&rdquo; recommendations to you, supposedly based on your preferences and your swiping history. Strangely enough, all of the recommendations seem suspiciously like the women who are least likely to get matches, as though the app is trying to get you to swipe on them to keep them from quitting, and to make you more likely to have a match, even if it&rsquo;s with someone you won&rsquo;t actually be interested in. The more of these you see, the more this supposed algorithm seems suspiciously bad to you, because it also keeps showing you people who have characteristics you&rsquo;ve specifically filtered out, like having kids, or being frequent users of hard drugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You try to hang in there, but as time drags on, you&rsquo;ve swiped on so many profiles that it&rsquo;s starting to show you ones outside of your filters, and now you&rsquo;ve gotta be extra careful to not swipe right on someone who uses hard drugs or has a dozen kids. It wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference if you did swipe right on them, of course, because you haven&rsquo;t matched with anyone else anyway, and it&rsquo;s not likely an accidental swipe will be the first. By the end of the month, you&rsquo;re rarely even bothering to check the daily recommendation it makes for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You bring your profile to your friends and ask for advice, you move pictures around, you change prompts, you agonize over word choice, trying to find something witty and engaging, but also trying to not have your whole profile be fake. You want it to still reflect you, because you do actually want someone to like </span><span class="c14">you</span><span class="c3">, but unfortunately, this strategy, for all its moral value and basic humanity, is woefully sub-optimal at getting matches. Eventually, you quit the app in disgust and vow never again to be so foolish, until your friends bully you into trying again six months later.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.yt13kn2jw6km"><span class="c34">The Female Experience</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You spend a bunch of time selecting pictures and filling out a&ndash; wait, how are there likes coming in already? You haven&rsquo;t even finished your profile yet! By the time you&rsquo;ve actually got everything set up, you&rsquo;ve got 10+ guys already lining up. Well, forget about swiping, just pay the subscription fee to see the likes and sort through those. By the time you&rsquo;re done buying it, the list is even longer. But still, this is exciting! You match with one or two and&hellip; oh, great, that guy sent a dick pic. Well, there&rsquo;s always going to be some bad apples, so you delete it and move on. Next match and&hellip; Hm, his opening line is a question you answered in the first part of your profile. That&rsquo;s not great either. The third just says &ldquo;hey bb u still up?&rdquo; You decide to just go to sleep and sort through this tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You come back and you&rsquo;ve got 100 likes in your inbox. How are you even remotely going to sort through all of that? You&rsquo;ve got a job, things on your schedule, when are you supposed to have time for this? But you also know how brutal the situation is for men, and you want to give them their fair shake, so at first, you try really hard to read each guy&rsquo;s profile. You think that maybe the ones who superliked you will be better matches, but most of them have nothing in common with you. The process starts to really drag, and soon you find yourself swiping left on guys after the first picture, and the more you do that, the easier it is to keep doing. But hey, wow, there&rsquo;s some really attractive men out there that are interested in you! That feels good. You match with a half dozen or so of those, excited about the potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A week later, you still haven&rsquo;t heard anything. This stings, and it also makes no sense. They liked you first! Why would they do that if they weren&rsquo;t really interested? They&rsquo;re super attractive, girls must be falling all over them, they didn&rsquo;t need to like you if they didn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c14">actually</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;like you. You expand your pool a little bit and now you&rsquo;ve gotten a few messages, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s strange how all these guys that had clever or interesting profiles can barely form sentences once you actually start talking to them. And even when they can carry on a conversation, it&rsquo;s pretty unsettling how quickly they snap into asking for pictures of your tits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You start to put less effort in, sorting through likes when you&rsquo;re on the toilet. You still haven&rsquo;t even once actually gone to the queue and swiped the traditional way, but why would you? You&rsquo;re having trouble keeping up even with the guys that liked you first, why spend a bunch of time swiping on guys who might not even like you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Eventually, a conversation goes somewhere. He&rsquo;s handsome, he&rsquo;s funny, he&rsquo;s sweet, and he seems genuinely interested in you. In fact, you can&rsquo;t seem to find anything wrong with him at all, and you&rsquo;re so excited to have met someone with actual potential that you don&rsquo;t notice that anyone who seems too good to be true, well, is. You go on a couple of dates, it seems to go really well, and he invites you back to his place after the second. That&rsquo;s a little fast for you, so you politely tell him you&rsquo;ve gotta be up super early for a meeting, but you can&rsquo;t wait for the next time you can see him. There&rsquo;s not a next time, of course, you never hear from him again, and somehow that hurts more than if no one had liked you at all. You write the next </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Person&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170411743&amp;usg=AOvVaw3O2eOq-iMdGbXoJuZ7gslP">Cat Person</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;story for the New Yorker and try to move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">That&rsquo;s the lucky scenario, of course, because just as often, you keep going on dates with him, only to learn later he&rsquo;s been seeing four other women the whole time. Or you discover that all the things that made you think he was really sweet, or really insightful, or really wholesome were actually just popular prompts he found on other sites, or even ChatGPT.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You start growing really resentful of this situation, and you&rsquo;re not alone.

Even the initial ego boost of receiving so many likes is quickly replaced; while 54% of women feel overwhelmed by the amount of messages they receive, 40% still feel insecure about not having received enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You&rsquo;re resilient enough to keep trying, but you&rsquo;re so soured on the experience, and so suspicious of each new guy you look at that you become even more selective. You start to read into every detail, hoping to be able to spot the signs of a liar or a cheater ahead of time. You can&rsquo;t really, because there just isn&rsquo;t enough information, but you reject more and more characteristics in the hope that you&rsquo;ll find the universal tell. If he says he values open and honest communication, that&rsquo;s proof he&rsquo;s just telling you what you want to hear. If his smile is a little off, it means he&rsquo;s faking it, and probably everything about him is fake. This doesn&rsquo;t really work the way you&rsquo;d hoped, but you&rsquo;d rather reject a bunch of possibly-decent guys than get ghosted again. If you&rsquo;re really lucky, you just never go on another date of the app, but if you&rsquo;re not, you cycle through a few more terrible matches, growing more bitter about it the whole time. Eventually, you quit the app in disgust and vow never again to be so foolish, until your friends bully you into trying again six months later.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.nkswa4633git"><span class="c34">Counter-Arguments and Conundrums</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>The most common counter that gets made is that people do actually meet and have long-term relationships, therefore dating apps don&rsquo;t work. This is a pretty weak argument, though, because it treats it as though the dating apps were the only way that could have happened. Maybe that&rsquo;s true for some percentage of the population, but it would be hard to argue that it&rsquo;s a high percentage, and around </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170415178&amp;usg=AOvVaw0wepfU52q34oO6Pt3C3etO">30% of adults have used a dating app</a></span><span class="c3">. Begging for food is preferable to starvation, but I think we can all agree that if 30% of the population was left with that as their only option, it&rsquo;d represent a catastrophic social situation. Any system that 30% of the population are using is going to have some successful examples just by sheer numbers. But despite 30% of adults having been on dating apps, only 10% are in relationships that resulted from them. .333 is a very good batting average, but it&rsquo;s a pretty poor success rate for anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>More interesting is a conundrum in the data that I can&rsquo;t entirely resolve. From the Pew study above, we know that 64% of men felt insecure about the number of messages they read, and from other data, we know that the bottom ~70% of men struggle to get any matches at all. Yet, in that same Pew study, 57% of men said that their time on dating apps was a somewhat or highly positive experience. I struggle to square these pieces of data, because even if your expectations are extremely low when going onto the dating app, surely getting zero matches can&rsquo;t </span><span class="c14">exceed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;those expectations, because what would be lower than that? Getting the police called on you? Embarrassment seems like the most likely explanation; saying that you had a negative experience feels a bit like admitting that you failed, so men may mentally reframe it in their survey response. Still, this is something I wish I could get a clearer understanding of.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.4e7wnp2icfh2"><span class="c25 c39">Perverse Incentives</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Look, let&rsquo;s face it: dating apps are terrible. They&rsquo;re not good at what they say they do, and they&rsquo;re also not good at anything else that they could be incidentally doing. Perhaps the more interesting question is </span><span class="c14">could</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;they be good or are the problems with them too inherent to what they are? After all, a lot of different types of people have created dating apps, most of which claimed to genuinely want to make it a good experience for users &ndash; some of whom even meant it, at least initially. But none of that has emerged in the actual results. Instead, the machinery of online dating churns out new apps every month, none of which are meaningfully more effective than the ones that came before, and most of which are entirely indistinguishable from what&rsquo;s already available. Is the elusive solution still out there, or is this all an exercise in futility?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At this point, I think the most likely outcome is that dating apps are fundamentally flawed in a way that can&rsquo;t be fixed, and the reason ultimately is that the incentives of all sides are too inherently perverse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">First and foremost, dating apps emphasize the most shallow and immediate sense of who people are. On a dating app, you are six pictures and the answers to three blurbs. Can you condense your true self down to that? If the answer is no, then the optimal strategy is to just lie, presenting whatever highly curated image is most popular with the opposite sex. Many people don&rsquo;t bother filling out much of their profile at all[6], just focusing their attention on their pictures, and the instant, easy nature of swiping only incentivizes this more. There&rsquo;s simply no space to be a distinct, complete human being on a dating app, and instead, people spend a lot of their time making quick judgments about what they see, including significant, often entirely baseless inferences from the data present in the pictures: &ldquo;That picture has him next to a computer, so he&rsquo;s probably not outdoorsy enough&rdquo;, or &ldquo;she&rsquo;s standing next to a guy her age in that pic, so she probably sleeps around a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">That these conclusions are drawn so quickly and with so little information isn&rsquo;t a bug of the format, it&rsquo;s basically the core design loop. Dating apps are a gamification of relationships, and the best way to keep players engaged is to keep them cycling through profiles as quickly as possible. That they miss out on real connections in the process is irrelevant; the players don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re missing, they have no way of seeing the possible futures where things could have worked out, and they continue to play, hoping they&rsquo;ll win on the next pull of the slot machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And when the only path to victory is to present the most curated, idealized version of yourself, the people who win the most are those who care the least about lying. </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tumblr.com/hotelconcierge/168172482919/the-false-negatives&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170423434&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YtC-eNzJJksYSjkX93rt1">When you favor the script, you favor the actor.</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you are honest and open, and you desire to be seen as you actually are, things are not going to go well for you, because while you&rsquo;re showing your real self, everyone else continues to present the curated image. Instead of standing out by being real, you simply end up being viewed as someone who isn&rsquo;t even competent at playing the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In many ways, dating apps just amplify the worst instincts of their users. Men become more shallow, lewd, and aggressive. From inside the app, the women on the other side of the screen stop being people at all, you can try sending a dick pic or a rude opener, and if your strategy doesn&rsquo;t work, you just close the message and move on. The miserable lopsidedness of gender on dating apps also harbors resentment as men increasingly feel like they&rsquo;re basically begging for women to even notice them. When they eventually leave the apps, still alone and unfulfilled, they do so also with shattered egos and ruined self-image, convinced that women just fundamentally can&rsquo;t be interested in them, making it even less likely that they pursue love through other channels &ndash; what would be the point, after all, if they&rsquo;re so unattractive that they can&rsquo;t get even 5 likes on an app?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On the other side, women&rsquo;s selectiveness quickly turns to snappy and extremely harsh judgment. Again, women rate </span><span class="c8">80% </span><span>of men as below average, indicating a level of selectiveness that&rsquo;s just not compatible with reality. Every detail of a man&rsquo;s pictures and every word choice he makes in his profile become proof of his inadequacy, an excuse to move on, until women </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/t9gkxu/what_percentage_of_people_on_dating_apps_do_you/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170426850&amp;usg=AOvVaw03g1BOPr7mOlq_5qkzivMN">start to become downright proud</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of all the people they reject. Eventually, the only men who pass the smell test are the ones whose profiles are perfect, who said every right thing, had wonderful pictures, and who passed every secret test of allegiance to the right politics and beliefs. Of course, anyone who is that perfect has the test key for your Scantron, they know exactly what you&rsquo;re weak to, and soon enough those women are being ghosted, left heartbroken, and growing even more resentful of men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Worst of all, this creates a feedback loop that&rsquo;s impossible for any individual to break out of. Men are required to have such a broad strategy (e.g. liking every profile) because women are so selective that their odds are very low, and the only way to increase them is to maximize the number of people they </span><span class="c14">could</span><span>&nbsp;match with. But on the other side, the more women men swipe on, the more matches women get, which drives women to be </span><span class="c14">more</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;selective. If a man chooses to not take the broad strategy of liking every profile, he torpedoes his own chances of a match because every other guy will keep doing it. Likewise, if a woman chooses to stop being highly selective, she&rsquo;ll have to deal with the dilemma of matching with every single guy on the site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t say any of this to blame men or women categorically. It&rsquo;s just that the interaction of our base, biological natures and this carefully designed system leads to our worst instincts ruling our decisions. The more we interact with quick, curated, incredibly superficial versions of people, the more warped our perception of normal becomes, the less willing we are to tolerate deviation from the ideal, and the harder it is to be accepted for our flaws in turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Is there a theoretical dating app that solves all of these, that brings out people&rsquo;s best instincts instead? I&rsquo;ll concede that it&rsquo;s hypothetically possible, but it wouldn&rsquo;t resemble in any form or fashion the options we currently have available. I&rsquo;m not convinced it could function as an app at all. So the next time somebody offers you some new app that&rsquo;s supposed to be way better, but is only 5% different from what already exists, you can feel confident in rejecting it outright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a creative new way of dropping an anvil on your foot&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t actually a very compelling pitch.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.3dylg8pw6qj"><span class="c25 c39">The Disease</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dating apps are so bad, so malicious, and designed so clearly to squeeze the human soul and collect all the valuable goo that seeps out, that it feels like it would be dishonest to not just call them evil. The desire for love and sex and companionship is so fundamental to the human experience, and the deliberate exploitation and destruction of that is so damaging to individuals and society as a whole that anything short of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t feel like it covers it. It is an engine that burns humans as fuel and generates misery. A dramatic reading, perhaps, but I think the evidence speaks for itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But, as much as the dating apps are making things much, much worse, it still feels like they&rsquo;re a symptom rather than the underlying disease[7], which is that we&rsquo;ve eliminated all of the traditional methods for people to find love. The way relationships are best fostered is by getting to know each other in a friendly context first, so that you know the other person reasonably well before having to make the decision about whether you have romantic interest in them. That way, you&rsquo;re not just dealing with superficial first impressions, but a deeper understanding of who they actually are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But the old ways of doing so are gone. Relationships with coworkers of any kind are discouraged, despite those being the people we spend the most time with and also are preselected to have things in common with. Men are less willing than ever to approach a stranger for a date, and women are less likely to want them to. And, most importantly, the close network of friends and family has mostly evaporated, so there&rsquo;s no one to introduce anyone in a safe setting the way there once was. It seems the sad truth is that dating apps didn&rsquo;t really force out these other options, so much as they just stepped into the gap the old ways left behind. A void was formed, and the misery engine was wheeled in to fill it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The old ways had really important protections also, forged over thousands of years of trial-and-error. Your close family friend-turned-romantic-interest couldn&rsquo;t ghost you, at least not easily, because there would be ramifications throughout his entire social network. If they were actually seeing a bunch of other people around town, everyone would know. Trying to go broad and ask out every girl you met went very poorly, because everyone knew you were doing it, and therefore that you didn&rsquo;t have a strong interest in any of them. And being overly selective was both unnecessary and carried a cost; rejecting people on a shallow basis would damage you in the eyes of that person&rsquo;s friends, who were probably also </span><span class="c14">your</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t know how we get back to a world where connections can happen organically, if it&rsquo;s even possible, or if we&rsquo;ll just have to figure out new solutions. That&rsquo;s unfortunately outside the scope of this review.

All the data that would be really useful and informative, the company&rsquo;s internal numbers for things like match rate, swipe frequency, user gender balance, etc. are all closely guarded secrets (they weren&rsquo;t always! OKCupid, for example, used to publish a lot of its own internal data before Match Group bought it). Some of these I can </span><span class="c14">somewhat </span><span class="c3">understand for security reasons. But, judging by the approximate results of third-party research, most of this data seems to be clearly locked away because it would be very unflattering to the app&rsquo;s efficacy, or would be very discouraging to users, or very often both. Perhaps better data would contradict my conclusions, but until they provide it, I just have to reason with what I have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[3] The prices don&rsquo;t seem to be present on any of the official sites when viewing the list of features, presumably because they want you to have already decided you want it before you see how much it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[4] They all call it something different, a SuperLike on Tinder, a SuperSwipe on Bumble, a Rose on Hinge, but I haven&rsquo;t found any difference in function.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[5] They have yet to call them &ldquo;barrel o&rsquo; superlikes [BEST VALUE!]&rdquo;, but the similarities to mobile game microtransactions is notable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">[6] I have searched exhaustively trying to find real data about how much of their profile people fill out and how it correlates with their results, but I&rsquo;ve come up with nothing.

Let us turn to death and review great women. In Joan of Arc, Mata Hari, and Princess Diana, we find not just historical figures but powerful myths of the saint, the whore, and the princess, whose struggles with power, survival, and authenticity only became clear once they were gone.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc, Mata Hari, and Princess Diana each represent a distinct path in the feminine experience: the Maiden, the Vixen, and the Damsel. Below is a look into their inner lives, moral journeys, and reviews of those travels as reflections for our own, inviting us to think about the choices that shape who we become; whether to stand, bend, or break.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc grew from a sheltered peasant into a brave leader who answered a divine call. She left her home to challenge the rigid institutions of her time, even though it meant sacrificing everything, including her life. Her transformation, marked by a willingness to embrace danger and reject traditions, shows us the power and cost of conviction to stand by one&rsquo;s beliefs.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari took a very different route. She reinvented herself using her charm and allure, navigating a world where seduction could be both shield and weapon. Her life, full of shifting identities and calculated moves, reveals how relying on surface appearances can hide inner doubts. In the end, her downfall teaches us that using illusion as a substitute for genuine self-growth leads only to ruin.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Princess Diana lived a life of public adoration and personal struggles. Born into high privilege, she still felt the weight of dependency and the pain of vulnerability. Her experiences highlight the risks of passivity in a world that calls for both emotional openness and firm decision-making. Her legacy is a complex blend of compassion and lost potential, urging us to find a balance between empathy and independence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">By comparing their lives and deaths, we learn that each journey carries its own lessons. Joan shows us the value of inner strength and sacrifice, Mata Hari warns against the perils of hiding behind sexual power, and Diana challenges us to turn vulnerability into more genuine empowerment. Their stories call on us to examine our own paths and strive to build identities that are both true and resilient.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c113 c17 c9">Programming Note</span><span class="c17 c9">: Unlike Plutarch, I&rsquo;m not going to go through the lives of these three women in an academic and distanced way. Such truths are better done by the biographers. Instead, I wanted to try out, with your permission, a more intimate method. I&rsquo;m going to write vignettes of the critical moral junctures in their lives. Episodes that are up close; that are in the room. The places where their lives diverged, often over a single decision. To be clear, I am trying to maintain as much truth as we can know, but this method incurs </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">heavy</span><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;speculation. I hope you will agree that this better fits the aim. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.jfg60bfhx7we"><span class="c25 c39">Three Deaths</span></h2><h3 class="c10 c79" id="h.inl6mgtxy5y0"><span class="c34">Mata Hari</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The military office reeks of paper and power. Mata Hari sits stiffly, her eyes fixed on the French intelligence officer; a face she will remember as the shots ring out. Outside, Paris of 1916 carries on its wartime rhythm; the Great War has transformed the City of Light into a place of shadows and suspicion. In here, time narrows to a single choice that will undo her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Your Russian captain lost an eye at Brimont,&quot; the agent states, sliding a photograph across the desk. The image shows Vadim Maslov in a hospital bed, his face partly shrouded in bandages. Mata Hari&#39;s fingers hover over it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I need to see him,&quot; she says.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;As a Dutch national, you can&#39;t visit the front unless you offer something to France,&quot; he reminds her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;My connections are social, not military,&quot; she replies in a deliberately exotic accent. &quot;Men talk to me of pleasure, not war plans.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;But, they do talk,&quot; he counters. &quot;And in this war, even soft comfort matters.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her chest tightens. Vadim matters to her. Unlike the parade of aristocrats who have shared her bed, the young Russian captain stirred something in her she believed was dead: raw affection.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;What exactly do you want?&quot; she asks, her voice dropping.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The War had destroyed her livelihood. With all of Europe&#39;s aristocracy either fighting or dead, her exotic dances play to sparse halls. Her bank accounts dwindled as borders closed. Espionage wasn&#39;t a choice; it was the only path remaining.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Information. About German officers, especially those in Madrid. You have connections, use them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The choice is clear: betray her German admirers or abandon the wounded captain she loves. Her mind drifts to her transformation from a powerless colonial wife to a drunken officer into Mata Hari, &quot;eye of the day&quot; in Malay, a supposed Javanese princess. She had turned men&#39;s exotic fantasies into power, all by herself.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">But war shifts the balance. Her beauty, though still present, no longer commands high sums.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I&#39;ll be paid,&quot; she states with cold precision.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Absurdly,&quot; the agent replies, naming a sum that eases immediate requirements.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I am Dutch. I am neutral.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Neutrality is a luxury for those who need nothing,&quot; he says.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her hands tremble as she signs the papers. Damnation, again.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Here are your papers for the hospital visit. You&#39;ll hear from us about the next steps,&quot; he adds.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She nods and steps into the hallway. The door closes behind her like a cell lock.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">As she walks the corridor with perfect posture, Mata Hari feels the first tremors of an earthquake that will topple her life. She once believed she was the hunter, but now, she realizes, she has always been prey.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">$$$</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The Grand Hotel suite gulps in the light. Even with every lamp on, shadows cling to the corners like conspirators in the February nights of 1917. Mata Hari sits at her vanity, dusting powder over exhaustion, dragging kohl along eyes that have seen too much. Her hands work fast. Her mind, faster.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Escape routes. Safe houses. Ships to Spain. She counts possibilities like a gambler tallying chips before the last bet.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The mirror gives her back a face still striking, but years have settled in. Fine lines trace the territory of forty, each one a receipt for survival in a world built to devour her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;One more night,&quot; she murmurs to the glass. &quot;One more performance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Six months since Captain Ladoux made his offer: one million francs for intelligence on German military plans. The timing had been perfect. War had dried up her clientele. Debts were piling up.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She didn&#39;t tell him she was already bought: Agent H-21. Three months earlier, the Germans had paid her 20,000 francs for vague promises about French secrets. A game, really. She fed them gossip any diplomat could hear over dinner.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A knock. A messenger. Another note from Ladoux: INFORMATION INSUFFICIENT. MORE SPECIFICS REQUIRED: CROWN PRINCE&#39;S CONTROL OF ARMY GROUP. TOMORROW: 9 AM.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She crumples the paper. The Crown Prince is a fraud, a playboy who cares more for women than war. Ladoux won&#39;t hear it. They want her to extract secrets that don&#39;t exist.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The room feels too small. She goes to the window. Paris is out there, still trying to be Paris. Couples stroll through the Tuileries, pretending.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She turns back to her ledger. The numbers confirm what she already knows: she&#39;s running out of time. Ladoux doles out money like a miser. The Germans pay better, but they&#39;re getting nervous. Her balancing act is slipping.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The decision comes quick. The trunks are already half-packed. Spain is neutral. From there, she can disappear.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;One last performance,&quot; she tells herself, sorting through papers. Dutch passport. French identification. A letter of safe passage from the German consul. Useful. Or damning, if the French find it first.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She doesn&#39;t notice how the hotel staff lingers near her door. How the switchboard operator holds the line a beat too long. How the shadows have started watching.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">That evening, she dresses for dinner. A Spanish diplomat who can smooth her passage. She descends the grand staircase like a queen, unhurried. No one would guess she&#39;s running.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17 c9">She doesn&rsquo;t see the telegram sent minutes after she leaves, about the warning for British port authorities to watch for her on the </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">Zeelandia</span><span class="c16 c9">, to arrest her, to take her to London, and to make Scotland Yard loosen her lips yet again.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In the taxi, she exhales, thinking herself the master of her fate.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">$$$</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Madrid feels untouched by the war. At the Hotel Ritz, chandeliers glow, champagne flows, and laughter bounces off marble columns. Mata Hari moves through the glittering scene like a ghost of her past self, her eyes always watching. Across the room, Major Arnold Kalle stands with military stiffness. He doesn&#39;t look at her like a man drawn in, but like a man taking notes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Major,&quot; she says, voice warm against January&#39;s chill. &quot;How gracious of you to meet me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Fr&auml;ulein Zelle.&quot; He uses her real name, a quiet reminder of control. &quot;Spain agrees with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Neutrality always does.&quot; She sits with the practiced ease of a dancer who knows exactly how to be seen. Just enough d&eacute;colletage to catch his eye, not enough to cheapen it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She leans in. &quot;I could be useful to the Kaiser. For the right price, I might share the French officers&#39; whispers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">No thrill passes between them, just the cold friction of a deal being struck. Her real goal is bigger: access to the Crown Prince. Captain Ladoux promised a million francs for information on Wilhelm&#39;s son.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;And what exactly could you provide that my own intelligence officers cannot?&quot; Kalle asks.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Access,&quot; she says, accent thickening. &quot;Men tell me things they wouldn&#39;t tell their shadows. I dance between worlds.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">What she doesn&#39;t say is that her world is shrinking. The British interrogation at Canon Row stripped away her mystique.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Kalle names his price: ten thousand francs.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">An insult. Once, men had thrown fortunes at her feet. Men in his own government. Now, war drains Europe&#39;s appetite for indulgence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;The French are more generous,&quot; she says smoothly.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;The French are desperate.&quot; Kalle smiles thinly. &quot;Germans are careful investors.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Once, this game had felt like power. But now, both sides want more than pillow talk.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I&#39;ll need documents,&quot; she says. &quot;Safe passage. Recognition.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She doesn&#39;t realize how her hand trembles, how forced her charm feels. Kalle sees it all. H-21 is no longer an asset. She&#39;s a risk.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Of course,&quot; he says too easily. &quot;I&#39;ll arrange what&#39;s necessary. And perhaps, a meeting with someone important.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;The Prince?&quot; Her eyes light up. He notices.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Perhaps. You&#39;ll see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She takes the elevator to her suite, picturing the gown she&#39;ll wear for the Prince Wilhelm. Meanwhile, Kalle walks to the secure communications office.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">He drafts a message to Berlin about agent H-21, deliberately using a cipher he knows the French have broken. It paints her as a double agent, with falsehoods about troop movements tied directly to her. The message isn&#39;t just a report; it&#39;s a death sentence. Still, he waits to send it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The French will think they&#39;ve uncovered the reason for their battlefield losses. The Germans eliminate a liability while making her death serve the war effort; perfect usefulness for a woman who has outlived her value.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In her suite, Mata Hari prepares for bed. In the mirror, she still sees the woman who dazzled Europe, who transformed from the discarded wife of a drunk colonial officer into a legend. What she doesn&#39;t see is that the game changed. The world doesn&#39;t need courtesans who trade in charm. It needs fodder. And she is an aperitif.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">$$$</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The military courtroom is all sharp angles and hard surfaces, built to intimidate. Five officers sit in judgment, their faces as rigid as their uniforms. No public, no press, no defense witnesses. This isn&#39;t justice; it&#39;s theater. And Mata Hari has been cast as the seductress-spy, the woman who lured men to doom.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The European war machine needs scapegoats for the millions dead in the trenches, and she&#39;s perfect: foreign, female, and too familiar with men on both sides.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Captain Pierre Bouchardon stands. For months, he&#39;s been her interrogator, picking apart her past. Now he&#39;s her prosecutor.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;We have before us a woman who took from France while serving Germany,&quot; he says. &quot;A woman who made her body a weapon, whose promiscuity led to the deaths of thousands.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari sits straight-backed in the dock, dressed in a tailored suit instead of flowing silks. She prepared for this moment like she once prepared for the stage. Hair pinned neatly, makeup suggesting vulnerability without weakness.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She watches Bouchardon like a chess player sizing up an opponent. He lays out the evidence: meetings with German officers, travels across borders, payments from the enemy. Taken alone, each fact means nothing. Together, they paint her as a traitor.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her lawyer, &Eacute;douard Clunet, sits beside her, powerless. He can&#39;t cross-examine witnesses or call his own.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">When she finally speaks, her voice is steady. &quot;The telegrams are fake,&quot; she says. &quot;Yes, I took German money, to recover what was taken from me in Berlin.&quot; She lifts her chin defiantly, eyes meeting each judge. &quot;A harlot? Yes, but a traitoress, never!&quot; The historic words hang in the air. &quot;I&#39;d never betray Paris.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Bouchardon holds up intercepted messages about &quot;Agent H-21.&quot; The details match her life exactly. The Germans sent them in a code they knew was broken. Yet they don&#39;t specify what information she passed on.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;You met Major Kalle in Madrid,&quot; Bouchardon presses. &quot;After that, these messages were sent. You admit to taking German money. You traveled freely while others could not.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I&#39;m an artist and a courtesan,&quot; she replies. &quot;My work requires travel. The Germans paid me for property they seized, not for secrets.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">It doesn&#39;t matter. France in 1917 needs a scapegoat. The war is going badly. The army nears mutiny. A scandalous spy trial is exactly the distraction needed.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Bouchardon moves in for the kill. &quot;At Canon Row, you told British intelligence you worked for the French. Why, unless you were playing both sides?&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I said I had an arrangement with Captain Ladoux,&quot; she clarifies. &quot;I never claimed to be a French agent.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;But you presented yourself as one when it suited you,&quot; he counters. &quot;Just as you were Dutch to Germans, Javanese to audiences, whoever you needed to be.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">That lands hardest. Her whole life has been reinvention. Now that adaptability makes her untrustworthy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">During a break, she&#39;s taken to a side room with Clunet. &quot;If you admit to taking German money but say you passed nothing of value, they might show leniency. They almost never execute women.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;They decided my guilt when they arrested me,&quot; she says.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;A confession could mean prison instead of a firing squad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She turns to him, jaw set. &quot;I won&#39;t give them the satisfaction. I wasn&#39;t a spy, and I won&#39;t play that part.&quot; A bitter smile flickers. &quot;The woman they&#39;ve created in that courtroom isn&#39;t me. And I won&#39;t become her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The verdict: &quot;Guilty of espionage.&quot; The sentence: &quot;Death by firing squad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">That night, in her cell at Saint-Lazare, she writes letters proclaiming her innocence. But deep down, she understands. She spent a lifetime playing roles, believing seduction, her body, could keep her safe. Now she&#39;s learned the truth: power borrowed is never really power at all.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">$$$</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Dawn comes slow at Vincennes, the sun reluctant for this performance. A thin mist clings to the field where twelve soldiers stand in formation. Their faces are hollow-eyed from war, none looking at the wooden post awaiting its occupant.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The prison transport arrives. Mata Hari steps out on her own. No chains. Nothing like the seductive myth that will come later. She walks to the post without hurry, her movements controlled. Not defiant. Not submissive. Something in between.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Would you like a blindfold, madame?&quot; an officer asks.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;No.&quot; Her voice is clear. Not a plea. A command.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Must I be seated?&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;No, madame.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She nods. A final courtesy granted. The soldiers shift uncomfortably, used to deserters who tremble and beg. Not women who meet them with steady eyes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In this moment, her last, Margaretha Zelle could rage at the injustice. She could tell them the truth: she wasn&#39;t the mastermind spy they claimed, but she wasn&#39;t innocent either. She had taken money from both sides, played a game without knowing the stakes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She could mention her children, one dead, one taken. She could speak of the husband who broke her, the life built from wreckage.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">But that wasn&#39;t her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She had spent a lifetime crafting illusions: the Javanese princess, the temple dancer, the courtesan. Now she makes one last creative choice. No explanations. Just a final gesture to steal the crowd.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She straightens her spine, lifts her chin, and blows a kiss to the firing squad.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A soldier blinks. The journalist scribbles, knowing he&#39;s witnessing something that will outlive them all.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Ready!&quot; the officer calls.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari doesn&#39;t flinch.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Aim!&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She looks past them, to some distant place no bullet can reach.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Fire!&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The shots crack through the cold morning air. For a moment, she remains upright. Then slowly, she sinks to her knees, head still up, expression unchanged. For a fraction of a second, she totters there. Then falls backward, bending at the waist, legs doubled beneath her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A non-commissioned officer approaches. He draws his revolver and fires a final shot into her head, ensuring execution, and immortality.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari, born Margaretha Zelle, died on October 15th, 1917, age 41, four miles from the heart of Paris.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">$$$$$$</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Margaretha Zelle&#39;s execution wasn&#39;t just the death of a spy; it was a reckoning with how women survive in a world that both objectifies and erases them. Her journey from colonial wife to exotic dancer to condemned traitor was a constant negotiation with forces that gave her visibility only on their terms.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari turned circumstances into leverage. She played the role men wanted, using the mystique of the &quot;Oriental&quot; seductress to make herself valuable. If society would see her as an object, she would monetize it. But such borrowed power was never truly hers to keep.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">During the war, taking money from German intelligence while working with the French wasn&#39;t about loyalty; it was survival. Captain Ladoux&#39;s offer wasn&#39;t a moral dilemma but another transaction. German money wasn&#39;t treason in her eyes, just income in a war that had eliminated her clientele.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The tragedy wasn&#39;t her execution but how every move to control her fate tightened the trap. She played the game without realizing it was rigged. Her sexuality gave her access to men in power, but only on their terms. Her espionage was less about strategy and more about staying afloat in a system designed to discard women once they stopped being useful.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">When she refused the blindfold before the firing squad, she defined herself on her own terms. No pleading, no fear, just a woman facing the void. Yet even this became legend, while Margaretha Zelle, the woman, disappeared behind the myth.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her story still unsettles because it raises questions we continue to struggle with. She wasn&#39;t villain or hero; just a broken someone trying to survive in a world that would never let her win.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.478eg2c10ooz"><span class="c34">Diana </span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The July light slipped through the heavy brocade curtains of Diana&#39;s borrowed room at Buckingham Palace. Three weeks before the wedding that would turn her into the Princess of Wales, she sat alone, swallowed by the gilded furniture and thick silence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Outside, London carried on. Inside, time dragged. Nothing happened without approval.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She hadn&#39;t seen Charles in three days. &quot;Royal duties,&quot; they told her. At nineteen, she still believed in fairy tales, despite the growing evidence. Her gaze fell on the wedding dress sketch. Twenty-five feet of train. Too tight to breathe in. A dress fit for, well, a princess.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She thought of Park House, her childhood home. That loneliness had been simpler. Parents who split when she was seven. Boarding school. But this was different. This loneliness came with titles, protocols, invisible lines she kept crossing.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A lady&#39;s maid entered with a silver tray of correspondence. &quot;His Royal Highness asked that these be delivered for his review, Your Ladyship.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Leave them on the desk.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">One letter slipped loose. Diana picked it up. The handwriting was elegant, confident. A woman&#39;s. Camilla.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Before she could second-guess, she slid the letter from its envelope. &quot;My darling,&quot; Her stomach turned. &quot;...such a wonderful weekend at Highgrove... when this tedious business is concluded, we can...&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Your Ladyship? The Commonwealth Youth reception is in thirty minutes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana tucked the letter back, lining up its edges like it had never been touched.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She caught her reflection: a girl who suddenly saw the cracks in her own future. Then, the expression vanished. Her face rearranged itself into the one the world expected.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her dresser entered with the afternoon outfit. &quot;The blue suit, with matching hat. Conservative, but youthful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana nodded, watching as she was shaped into someone fit for cameras. For a moment, she imagined another life. Walking away. Going back to the kindergarten classroom. The moment passed. She squared her shoulders.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;The public is waiting.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her dresser smiled. &quot;You&#39;re learning fast. You&#39;ll be a perfect princess.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana turned away from the letter and left the room.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">January rain streaked down the nursery windows at Kensington Palace, turning the gardens into a soft watercolor blur. Diana sat beside her sleeping five-year-old son, her finger tracing the black embossing on a manila folder labeled &quot;Confidential.&quot; Inside were detailed records of her husband&#39;s betrayals: photographs, hotel receipts, telephone logs, and witness accounts gathered by private investigators she had hired.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Across the room, three-year-old Harry slept with one arm flung over his head, his red hair bright against the pillow. The nursery, with its hand-painted countryside mural and carefully chosen toys, stood in stark contrast to the formal splendor of the rest of the apartment. Here, Diana had built them a palace of normalcy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She opened the folder. A photograph slipped out: Charles and Camilla at Highgrove during a weekend when he had claimed to be fishing in Scotland. They weren&#39;t touching, but the closeness of their bodies spoke a damning language.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her throat tightened as she reread a transcript of a telephone conversation between Charles and his lover, their casualness hitting her hard. Their familiar language, cultivated over fifteen years, now made it impossible for her to speak with Charles.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A soft knock pulled her from her thoughts. Her personal secretary entered quietly. &quot;The rain isn&#39;t letting up, Your Royal Highness,&quot; he said, careful not to disturb the princes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Neither is this situation,&quot; Diana replied, gesturing to the folder.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;I&#39;ve reviewed the findings. There&#39;s no question the affair resumed, at least since late 1986.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana closed the folder. &quot;And the Prince of Wales&#39;s schedule?&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Unchanged for the coming month. The overlaps we noted remain.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her knuckles went white around a small gold locket containing photographs of her sons.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;There are options beyond silent endurance,&quot; the secretary offered carefully.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;What becomes of my children?&quot; she whispered. &quot;What becomes of my duties?&quot; They both recalled the history of royal divorces: the exile of wives who dared break vows. She dismissed him with a wave.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">With deliberate movements, Diana crossed to her writing desk. She unlocked the bottom drawer with the key she wore on a chain, placed the folder inside, and locked it again. &quot;Arrange my schedule for the AIDS hospice visit tomorrow,&quot; she instructed, her voice steadier. &quot;No photographers for the first hour, and confirm my meeting with Captain Hewitt. Tea at four, here at Kensington.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Returning to her sleeping children, Diana settled by William&#39;s bedside. The line between her public performance and inner doubts grew sharper; a split that would soon define her life. It wasn&#39;t freedom, but it was resistance.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The fluorescent lights of London Middlesex Hospital cast a harsh glow over the AIDS ward, where the smell of disinfectant barely hides the scent of medicine and decay. Diana, Princess of Wales, moves through the quiet corridor with cameras following at a respectful distance. Her lapis blue suit stands out against the gray walls, a deliberate splash of cheer. Six years into her royal role, she has learned that every color, every accessory, every gesture is scrutinized.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Perhaps Your Royal Highness would prefer not to enter directly,&quot; the medical director suggests. &quot;We could bring some of our less acute cases to the day room.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana meets his gaze steadily. &quot;This Royal Highness has come to see your patients where they live, not where it&#39;s convenient to show them off.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">AIDS is still shrouded in fear and misunderstanding. Headlines scream about a &quot;gay plague,&quot; and even doctors treat patients like dangerous objects rather than humans. The royal family has kept its distance from the epidemic, addressing topics like sex and homosexuality only in vague terms.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">At the threshold of the first room, Diana pauses. Inside, a young man, no more than thirty, with sunken cheeks and paper-thin skin, lies in bed. The sound of clicking cameras fills the air. Everyone expects a princess to remain distant, to offer words of support without breaking the invisible line between the healthy and the afflicted.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana slowly removes her gloves and hands them to her lady-in-waiting, sending a ripple through the staff. In an era when fear suggests even casual contact might spread the virus, the sight of the Princess approaching a patient with bare hands is radical.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Hello, John,&quot; she says, extending her hand gently. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to meeting you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Their fingers touch. She feels the slight tremor of his grip, the cold pressure of his skin. In that moment, it&#39;s not the illness she registers, but the relief of genuine human contact.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Your Royal Highness,&quot; he whispers, voice rough with disuse. &quot;You really shouldn&#39;t, your hands...&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana smiles the smile they made her practice a thousand times. &quot;I have two good hands that are much happier being useful than hidden away in gloves, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Her eyes flick to just glimpse the crews aflutter.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Behind her, camera shutters click faster. Newspapers have already received their front-page image: the Princess of Wales, breaking protocol by holding the hand of a dying man with AIDS.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">For the next hour, Diana moves from room to room, sitting on beds, adjusting pillows, listening to stories that cannot be faked.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;You&#39;re the first visitor Simon&#39;s had in three months,&quot; a nurse whispers. &quot;His family disowned him when they learned he was gay, even before the diagnosis.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;You&#39;re not like what I expected from TV,&quot; Simon tells her. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful, but you&#39;re real, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana feels a lump in her throat. &quot;I&#39;m trying to be,&quot; she replies softly.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Later in the car, Diana reviews her planner, running her finger along carefully chosen engagements: visits to children&#39;s hospitals, meetings with marginalized communities, charity events where her style brings attention to important causes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She notices a newspaper clipping in her diary; a picture of her embracing a child at a homeless shelter. But her eyes now betray a calculation: these moments build a separate narrative, one that gives her independence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The car glides toward Kensington Palace. Diana has acted with real compassion, yet she has used that compassion as a tool in the battle for public opinion and personal freedom. She is building her identity on an unstable foundation, creating a scaffold of dependency no different from the one she longs to escape.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Late afternoon sunlight spilled through the windows of Diana&#39;s office at Kensington Palace, illuminating dust motes dancing in golden beams. She sat surrounded by photographs of her sons, watercolors, and gifts from humanitarian travels, reviewing a letter outlining her post-divorce financial responsibilities.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The telephone rang. &quot;Diana speaking,&quot; she answered.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Princess! Mo here.&quot; Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s voice filled the line. &quot;I&#39;m inviting you and the boys to my compound in France. My yacht is at your disposal, a perfect break from the press. Dodi would ensure you have everything you need.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;That&#39;s very kind,&quot; she replied noncommittally. &quot;Let me check the boys&#39; schedules.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her thoughts drifted to Hasnat Khan, the heart surgeon whose relationship with her had recently ended. &quot;I cannot live in a gilded cage,&quot; he had told her. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on Diana: she had escaped one cage only to find fame had built her another.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A Metropolitan Police officer entered with a folder. &quot;We&#39;ve completed the security assessment. We recommend a full detail, especially when traveling with the princes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;You mean surveillance,&quot; Diana countered firmly.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Our concern is your safety. The recent campaign has generated several credible threats.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana walked to the window, gesturing vaguely toward Buckingham Palace. &quot;I need distance from all that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">After he left, she read a letter bearing the Prime Minister&#39;s seal, Tony Blair had written about government platforms for her charity work.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her assistant interrupted: &quot;Frances Shand Kydd has called again. That&#39;s the third time this week.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana&#39;s jaw tightened at mention of her estranged mother. &quot;Tell her I&#39;m unavailable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The assistant placed a newspaper on her desk. The headline read: DI AND DODI: ROMANCE ON THE RIVIERA? Grainy photos showed Diana on Al-Fayed&#39;s yacht with Dodi.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Left alone, Diana studied photographs of her sons. William, fifteen, resembled his father, while Harry remained unmistakably Spencer, her spirit shining through.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Through her window, photographers gathered at the palace gates: the public fascination that had become both her strength and vulnerability.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The competing demands pulled at her; charities, media, family, and now Al-Fayed. His invitation promised luxury and protection, but at what cost?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She picked up the phone. &quot;Tell Mr. Al-Fayed we accept his invitation. His compound&#39;s security will do.&quot; As she spoke, she pushed aside Blair&#39;s proposal.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">When Dodi called to arrange her visit, Diana made the arrangements while part of her watched from a distance. She recognized the pattern: an eager companion, luxurious settings, protection without complications; a comfortable escape.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Blair&#39;s letter caught her eye again, offering something tougher but more fulfilling: purpose instead of pleasure, impact instead of escape.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">For a moment, Diana&#39;s face showed full awareness of her choices. Then she returned to thinking about which clothes to pack, as photographers focused their lenses on her window, capturing the silhouette of a woman whose search for freedom had led her into captivity again.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The pale light of Parisian streetlamps spilled through the tall windows at the Ritz Hotel&rsquo;s rear entrance, pooling beneath the awning. Faces gathered in the dim glow, their features softened. Diana stood with her arms crossed, a gesture of quiet self-protection, as Henri Paul outlined their plan to evade the paparazzi.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve confirmed almost thirty photographers at the main entrance,&rdquo; Paul said, his French accent taut. &ldquo;The decoy vehicle will leave from the front. Meanwhile, you and Mr. Fayed will exit through the service door on Rue Cambon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana nodded, glancing toward the idling black Mercedes. The car was both an escape and a trap, freedom in motion, but with no real exit. Its waxed paint and tinted windows distorted her reflection: the same girl, the same cycles, the same people, moving her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Dodi Fayed stood apart, checking his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly midnight. We should move if we want to reach the apartment without incident.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The hotel manager approached. &ldquo;Madame, we have a secure private suite if you prefer to stay until morning. We can arrange a safe departure later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana looked back at the plush interior, a haven, perhaps. But Dodi&rsquo;s hand came to rest lightly at the small of her back.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;The apartment is minutes away. Father has arranged everything for our comfort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Trevor Rees-Jones, Mohamed Al-Fayed&rsquo;s protection officer, shifted uneasily. &ldquo;The paparazzi presence is heavy tonight. Perhaps it&rsquo;s wiser to wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">For a moment, Diana&rsquo;s face reflected not fear, but clarity. She saw the pattern of her life: cameras chasing, choices narrowing. The pursuit had been both torment and validation: shaping her image, confirming her relevance.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She glanced again into the hotel: safety behind doors. Then at the Mercedes, at Dodi. Symbols of movement, escape, and everything that had defined her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In that moment, Diana recognized the complicity. She had been running for so long; from Charles, the palace, the expectations of her name. The illusion of choice was its own prison.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She moved toward the exit.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; she said, voice flat and steady.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Paul took the wheel, his eagerness shadowed by the glassiness in his eyes. Diana slid into the backseat without fastening her seatbelt; a small act of neglect, or defiance.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The Mercedes pulled into the Parisian night. For this moment, Diana existed fully in the present, defined by the flight that had always been her way.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana, Princess of Wales, died August 31st, 1997, age 36, three miles from the heart of Paris.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In death, Diana won a strange kind of freedom from the institutions that had always confined her and secured her place in the public imagination. The wreckage in the Parisian underpass beneath the Seine marked the collision of forces that had defined her life: relentless media attention, endless evasion that only fueled scrutiny, and a series of relationships that promised protection but imposed new constraints.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">This was the hollow victory for the damsel; immortalized by public adoration yet never allowed to shape her own identity. Her death did not free her memory; it froze her as an eternal icon of vulnerability instead of allowing her true self to manifest.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Throughout her 36 years, Diana swapped one form of dependence for another. Once, she was the fairy-tale princess, the bride curtsying before her husband&#39;s portrait. Later, she became a wronged wife defined by victimhood, and then a celebrity humanitarian whose worth was measured by public approval. Every role demanded an audience; every phase, validation. The cameras she both chased and fled became mirrors, reflecting a life defined by others.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Even after shedding the formal constraints of royal life, she never broke from the invisible chains of public expectation. The divorce that should have freed her only deepened her reliance on the spotlight. Her rejection of royal security meant one form of control ended, only to be replaced by even more invasive scrutiny. Each apparent step toward independence entangled her further in the web of observation she had spent decades trying to escape.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In her relationships, Diana moved from one dependency to another, seeking in others the validation she could not find within herself. From Charles, who offered status without love, to her later companions, each connection represented a desperate bid for security that ultimately failed to provide the freedom she sought.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana&#39;s final tragedy was not simply her death, but that she never discovered who she might have become if she had allowed herself to claim her own power. Her legacy is a blend of extraordinary compassion and a life defined by others&#39; reflections, her true self always just out of reach.</span></p><h3 class="c10 c79" id="h.42kopbtbv7df"><span class="c34">Joan of Arc </span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The stone floor bites cold against Joan&rsquo;s kneecaps. The dank tang of last night&rsquo;s rain clings to her woolen skirt, and each shift sends cramps spiraling up her thighs. She presses her forehead to the low bench, the hearth&rsquo;s glow barely chipping through the chill. Outside, the wind rattles the shutters like angry fists.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Then, no warning again, the voices slice into her thoughts, neither shout nor whisper, but as sharp as a lance between her ears. Saints Michael, Margaret, and Catherine.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;Joan, daughter of France, the Dauphin must be crowned at Reims. You will lead his armies. You will drive the English from Orl&eacute;ans.&rdquo; commands the archangel.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her breath catches. Fever&#8209;dream or divine command? A hot spike of dread cuts through her stomach: What will the neighbors say? Already Old Marguerite at the bakehouse whispers of witchcraft. The local priest edges closer by the day. She sweats into the rough wood crucifix beneath her shift and wonders: am I hearing His messages, or chasing some secret longing?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; Her mother&rsquo;s voice cracks, seeing the now familiar signs. She kneels beside her, hands fluttering. &ldquo;Not this again. You&rsquo;ll ruin us, everyone&rsquo;s talking. Your godmother swears you dance with spirits in the woods.&rdquo; Her eyes plead: stay, be sensible.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Snowflakes lilt as her father storms in, shoulders hunched against the draft. He halts, gaze hard, he knows. &ldquo;Speak of these voices once more, and I&rsquo;ll bury you out back where no one finds you.&rdquo; His threat trembles with fear: of English patrols, of scandal, of losing everything.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9 c16">Joan&rsquo;s heart hammers between obedience and something fiercer. The crucifix&rsquo;s edges gouge her skin as she squeezes it. Doubt and conviction coil together: is this her own will rising up, or a heavenly command?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She lifts her head. &ldquo;Father&hellip; I can&rsquo;t unhear them.&rdquo; Her voice wobbles on the brink of tears and steel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sworn&hellip; to a higher oath.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her mother&rsquo;s face drains pale; her father&rsquo;s jaw clenches. In that frozen instant, Joan feels both the weight of home and the pull of a destiny she barely understands.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She quickly gathers her few possessions: a coarse linen shift, a length of hemp cord, a handful of prayer beads: tools of a peasant girl turned pilgrim. Each item tugs her body away from safety and toward unknown roads.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">At the threshold, she pauses. Panic flutters: Will they rush after her? Will her courage hold when she names Robert de Baudricourt? A fragment of doubt lingers: Am I choosing this path, or has it chosen me?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The door thuds shut, muffling her parents&rsquo; voices and the hearth&rsquo;s warmth. The wind softens, as though yielding to her resolve. She steps into the hush of falling snow, her footprints carving a trembling line between doubt and purpose. Beneath her shift, fingers slide under the fabric to press the crucifix against her heart, trembling at her own audacity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">###</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Inside Baudricourt&rsquo;s fortified manor, the air is thick with torch smoke and the sour tang of boiled cabbage drifting from the kitchens. Horses shift in their stalls, chains clinking against stone. Joan stands before a tarnished bronze mirror, fingertips hovering over her uncle&rsquo;s borrowed knife, cold metal against calloused skin.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She hesitates: is she really about to do this? A stablehand snorts in the corridor; a steward snickers through the crack of the door.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">With a breath, Joan grasps her hair. As the blade bites through strands, a soldier glances sideways, lips pressed tight, then whispers, &ldquo;Hell, she means it.&rdquo; Dark locks drift to the floor like discarded banners. Her scalp pricks with rawness; liberation or foolishness?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">From behind, Baudricourt&rsquo;s boots clank across stones. He stops. &ldquo;Planning to storm our kitchen next?&rdquo; he jibes, eyebrows raised.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan&rsquo;s throat tightens. She brushes hair from her face. &ldquo;Some battles need more than knives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">He snorts. &ldquo;Prophets have bigger swords.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">A distant horn blast echoes. A footman stumbles in, breath ragged. &ldquo;Milord, Domr&eacute;my&hellip; it&rsquo;s ashes.&rdquo; Joan&rsquo;s jaw clenches so hard wood crackles in her skull. Fingers whip the knife&rsquo;s hilt until her knuckles whiten. The mirror&rsquo;s tarnish blurs.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She swallows. Does this path serve her own will, or something else? The gambeson&rsquo;s padded bulk chafes her shoulders, the linen beneath prickles against fresh skin. Still, she inhales the manor&rsquo;s stale air and stands straighter: between doubt and resolve, she&rsquo;ll carve her own course.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">###</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The acrid sting of smoke clings to Joan&rsquo;s nostrils as mud sucks at her boots. Horses snort in the half&#8209;light, their flanks heaving against fraying reins. She braces on a slick rise overlooking Orl&eacute;ans&rsquo;s battered walls, steel armor cold against her ribs, breath misting in the dawn chill.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Around a stained table, commanders argue over curled parchments. &ldquo;If we wait for the supply wagons,&rdquo; Dunois snarls, &ldquo;our men starve in the trenches.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">La Hire slams a fist on the map. &ldquo;But if we charge before nightfall, we bleed half our force under those ramparts!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan presses her sword pommel, feeling its cold weight. A distant trumpet blares. She blinks against the smoke, the saints in her head clamoring: now, Now. Yet a knot of fear tightens in her gut; this isn&rsquo;t prophecy, it&rsquo;s a gamble. She inhales damp air, tastes iron and ash, she knows this is the only way to convince them that God has sent her. She makes her choice.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; she says, voice barely above the wind. The commanders exchange doubtful glances, then nod.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">At her signal, trumpets sound. French lances surge forward, the ground shuddering under hooves. Within moments, chaos: a sergeant&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;Lieutenant! At my side!&rdquo; A wounded soldier clutches her cuirass, eyes glazed. &ldquo;Joan&hellip; help me&hellip;&rdquo; His plea lodges in his throat, raw and human.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">She hesitates. Save one man or press the assault? Her gauntlet sweats; the banner&rsquo;s weight snaps against wood. Determination flares. &ldquo;Onward!&rdquo; she shouts.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The line falters under English arrow storm from the flank. Heads crack, armor dents, men fall screaming in the mud. The Bastille de Saint-Loup looms ahead, its defenders steel&#8209;bright and grim. As French ranks splinter, Joan reels, heart pounding, lungs burning, but she spots a riderless destrier slipping from the fray. She vaults onto its back, the beast lurching beneath her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Holding her white banner high, she shouts&rdquo; In the Name of God!&rdquo;. Over and over, until she is hoarse. Around her, the tide reverses: a grizzled veteran pauses mid&#8209;step, mouth half&#8209;open, then mutters, &ldquo;I thought her white banner was a beacon, or a curse, &rsquo;til it turned the tide.&rdquo; His wonder carries through the line, and fresh courage surges.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">By dusk, the walls shudder as the gate gives way. In the commanders&rsquo; tent, Dunois leans forward, finger tracing spilled ink on the map. &ldquo;Do we press on?&rdquo; he asks.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan&rsquo;s gaze drifts to the flickering lanterns, to the smoky rafters above. She tastes dust and sweat. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; She falters, recalling the wounded soldier&rsquo;s plea, the frantic trumpet, the ache of uncertainty. Finally: &ldquo;We follow the best path we have: faith in our men, in ourselves, in Him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Silence settles, not holy hush but the weight of decision. Even her allies regard her with wary respect: a peasant girl whose courage feels both gift and burden.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">That night, she kneels on cold planks, mud crusted beneath her ribs. The saints have quieted to a dull thrum. She rubs her collarbone where the cuirass chafes, questions flutter: Was this her own will or something more? Her fingers brush the crude cross at her throat, a reminder that every step forward is both choice and calling. Soon, Orl&eacute;ans stands free, or falls, and Joan must own the path she carved.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">###</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The cell&rsquo;s damp cold settles into Joan&rsquo;s bones. Water drips from a fissure overhead, each plip echoing in the tight stone circle. Behind her, rats scratch the mortar; the damp seeps through her thin tunic, clinging to chilled skin. Iron shackles bite into her wrists where banners once sat easy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Eight guards in patched tabards shift at the bars, their lanterns throwing long shadows. Through the narrow window, bells toll for mass, promised to her, yet never granted.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Bishop Cauchon strides in, his crimson robe whispering across the flagstones. He smiles, measuring her from eye to shivering toe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re far too interesting to burn without extracting every last secret,&rdquo; he coos. Then, voice shifting: &ldquo;Refuse me, and I&rsquo;ll see you roasted in common witchcraft; and I&rsquo;ll enjoy the show.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan lifts her chin, breath catching on the rasp of her own voice. &ldquo;You promised me a woman&rsquo;s ward, female guards, mass&hellip; and these chains off my wrists.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">He arches an eyebrow. &ldquo;Promises change with convenience.&rdquo; He steps closer, ring glinting. &ldquo;Have your voices spoken since, after, you signed that confession?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Three days ago, under the torch&rsquo;s glare, she&rsquo;d signed away her visions to save her skin. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admits, throat tight and dry. &ldquo;Did He hear that lie?&rdquo; she thinks. In the hollow silence, the old certainty returns, not thunderous, but an insistence that she erred.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Cauchon&rsquo;s lips curve. &ldquo;Ah. So you still fancy yourself the Lord&rsquo;s mouthpiece?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her pulse pounds in her ears. The cell&rsquo;s drip sounds louder. She swallows, the metal collar chafing her neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die than deny Him again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">He inclines his head, mock solemn. &ldquo;Very well. You&rsquo;re relapsed. Tomorrow, the English will claim your body and scatter your ashes. No relics, no legends, just coals on the Seine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Outside her thin walls, the wind howls against Rouen&rsquo;s stones. She presses her back to the cold bricks, the voices inside her stirring, neither comfort nor torment but both. One part of her clings to each breath as a choice; faith or her own stubborn will. And in that tight, dripping dark, Joan knows the final act is hers.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">###</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The scrape of Joan&rsquo;s moldy sandals on the cobblestones echoes in her ears as she steps into Rouen&rsquo;s Vieux&#8209;March&eacute;. Tears sting her eyes, not from pain, but from dread. The spring air is cool, and each breath feels borrowed.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Around her, English soldiers heft heavy timbers. Their faces are set, but one youth&rsquo;s hand trembles as he aligns a beam for the pyre. Behind him, the crowd shifts uneasily, some avert their gaze, others press forward, curiosity and pity warring in their expressions.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan walks between her guards with measured dignity. Her coarse leggings and tunic hang loose on her wasted frame; each ragged fold reminds her of what she&rsquo;s left behind. The sentence is read aloud in clipped Latin no one else understands: heresy, schism, idolatry, demon worship. Joan&rsquo;s eyes stay fixed on the wavering flame of a single torch.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Soldiers bind her wrists to the pillar&rsquo;s rough surface. The ropes cut into her skin, and for a moment she hesitates: &ldquo;Is this my choice, or a destiny forced upon me?&rdquo; She presses her cheek to the cold, feeling its grain beneath tears.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">An older soldier, gaunt and silent until now, steps forward clutching a crude cross he&rsquo;s fashioned from broken sticks. His fingers are stained with ash and sweat. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he murmurs, voice low. Joan accepts it, fingers brushing his in an accidental spark of human connection. She kisses the cross, throat tight.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">When the executioner approaches with a torch, she does not plead or rail. Her voice is barely above the crackle of kindling: &ldquo;He knows my heart.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s neither boast nor prayer, but a last fragile confession.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">As flames lick the pyre&rsquo;s base, Joan closes her eyes. The heat presses against her face, and she thinks of fields left behind, of voices that once guided her, now silent. Some in the crowd cross themselves; others drop to their knees. But none can name the feeling that grips them. Joan is last seen muttering the words &ldquo;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus&rdquo; before the flames and smoke take her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Later, when the pyre has burned low, soldiers gather the ashes. In the Seine&rsquo;s current, cinders float downstream and blur into dusk, neither triumph nor tragedy, but something in between, carried onward by wind and water, leaving each to reckon with what remains.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17 c9">Joan of Arc died May 30</span><span class="c17 c74 c9">th</span><span class="c16 c9">, 1431, at age 19, 71 miles northwest of Paris.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">######</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc&#39;s journey began in innocence, a peasant girl tending hearth and home in Domr&eacute;my, existing in the protected but limited space society allowed her. When her saints first called, they disturbed this simple harmony, presenting her with a profound choice: remain in safety or risk everything for a truth that burned within.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her initial hesitation revealed the depth of her internal conflict. The familiar world offered security but demanded she deny her deepest knowing. By embracing her visions despite warnings of pride or devilry, Joan performed her first act of courage: trusting her inner truth above external authority.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Leaving home marked her severance from protection. Each step away from Domr&eacute;my&#39;s familiar paths was a step toward self-sovereignty, trading dependence for the burden of purpose. This departure required more than physical courage; it demanded she reject the very framework that had defined her existence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">When Joan cut her hair and donned soldier&#39;s garb, she shed the confines and protections of prescribed femininity. The transformation was both practical and symbolic, an outward manifestation of her evolving consciousness. Though armor chafed and boots pinched, these discomforts represented liberation from old constraints, allowing her true strength to emerge.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">At Orl&eacute;ans, Joan confronted the responsibility of leadership. Hesitating briefly before charging forward, she experienced the weight of decisions that risked others&#39; lives. Here, conviction transformed from private belief to public action, bringing both inspiration and isolation. Her banner raised high revealed that authentic leadership flows not from dominance but from embodied truth.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Her imprisonment presented Joan&#39;s greatest test. In Rouen&#39;s cell, with her voices dimmed to whispers, she confronted her mortality. Her momentary surrender and signature on a confession revealed her humanity, the flickering doubt that accompanies even the most steadfast heart. Yet when pressed to permanently renounce her truth, Joan reclaimed her integrity, choosing death over compromise.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">As flames engulfed her at the stake, Joan completed her transformation. The girl who once feared speaking her truth now proclaimed it with her very life, transcending fear not through absence of terror but through courage that encompassed it. Her ashes scattered on the Seine represented the dissolution of her individual self into something eternal, a soul fully realized through surrender to its highest calling.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.c2cvutw7ka3m"><span class="c25 c39">Review of the Deaths</span></h2><h3 class="c67" id="h.14mcznj2topj"><span class="c34">Mata Hari &amp; Diana: The Price of Performance</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari and Princess Diana navigated patriarchal systems through opposing yet parallel performances: one wielding exotic allure, the other calculated vulnerability. Both strategies transformed disadvantage into influence, but neither delivered true freedom.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari&#39;s carefully crafted persona played into male fantasies, turning her body into currency as she traded secrets and sexuality for power. Diana, meanwhile, staged emotional openness as the &quot;Queen of Hearts,&quot; transforming personal pain into public appeal through AIDS patient embraces and candid confessions about her struggles. Where Mata Hari leveraged mystery, Diana deployed transparency; opposite methods serving identical purposes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Both women ultimately confused exposure with empowerment. Their strategies, whether Mata Hari&#39;s covert seduction or Diana&#39;s strategic vulnerability, relied on revealing intimate aspects of themselves to control other&rsquo;s perception. Yet this control remained illusory; neither escaped the systems exploiting them. Their performances merely negotiated slightly better positions within rigid structures.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Their shared legacy reveals a bitter truth: systems rewarding women&#39;s performance rarely permit transformation. Their temporary influence only deepened reliance on the very structures they sought to navigate. Both disappeared behind imposed identities, the seductive spy and the wounded princess, proving that genuine agency requires more than skillful role-playing. It demands dismantling the stage itself.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.ofjcoy1pjn7r"><span class="c34">Joan of Arc &amp; Diana: The Courage of Conviction and Cost of Compromise</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc and Princess Diana represent contrasting approaches to moral authority. Joan&#39;s power stemmed from unshakable inner conviction, a teenage peasant who transcended her era&#39;s limitations through inspired certainty. Her armor symbolized sacred purpose rather than rebellion. This unwavering faith led her to abandon family, lead armies, and ultimately embrace martyrdom because her inner truth mattered more than survival.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Yet Joan&#39;s conviction came at a profound cost: isolation. Her refusal to compromise alienated potential allies and left her standing alone against powerful institutions. The purity of her conviction made connection with others nearly impossible; a lonely path few could follow.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana, conversely, operated within inherited duty&#39;s constraints. Her genuine compassion remained tethered to royal expectations and public performance. Where Joan rejected societal rules outright, Diana navigated within them, often mistaking visibility for freedom. Her vulnerability, wielded as a weapon against royal coldness, ultimately trapped her in an endless cycle of seeking external validation.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Their divergent approaches highlight a fundamental tension in human agency. Joan&#39;s courage to define her own truth demanded complete sacrifice, including meaningful human connection. Diana&#39;s struggle to reveal her authentic self while maintaining public approval meant constantly compromising her voice to meet others&#39; expectations.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">One reminds us that moral authority begins with absolute faith in oneself; the other cautions that well-intentioned defiance can become another form of imprisonment when dependent on public perceptions. Joan&#39;s path transformed the world but at unimaginable personal cost; Diana&#39;s path offered connection but surrendered autonomy.</span></p><h3 class="c10 c79" id="h.g1k27mygecie"><span class="c34">Joan of Arc &amp; Mata Hari: Conviction&#39;s Flame vs. Survival&#39;s Mirage</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc and Mata Hari embodied opposing responses to oppression. Joan&#39;s power flowed from unshakable conviction; a divine certainty that transcended her era&#39;s limitations. She wore armor not as disguise but as expression of sacred purpose, making choices guided by unwavering faith rather than self-preservation. Even facing death, she remained His messenger first.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari instead wielded meticulous artifice. She transformed her identity into a commodity, her moral code flexible as she navigated a hostile world through seduction and deception. Where Joan&#39;s armor proclaimed truth, Mata Hari&#39;s silks concealed it, using men&#39;s fantasies as tools for survival in a system designed against her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Their approaches to agency reveal a fundamental tension: Joan found freedom through absolute commitment to principles, while Mata Hari sought it through strategic adaptability. Yet Joan&#39;s rigidity isolated her from human connection, while Mata Hari&#39;s flexibility ultimately trapped her within the very systems she manipulated.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">One woman&#39;s uncompromising stance created lasting moral authority that challenged power itself. The other&#39;s tactical compromises secured temporary advantage at the cost of authentic self-expression. Joan&#39;s legacy demonstrates that moral clarity, even at tremendous personal cost, transforms collective possibilities. Mata Hari&#39;s story suggests that survival-driven flexibility, though pragmatic, risks dissolving the self it aims to protect.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The contrast illuminates a central paradox: conviction provides genuine agency but demands great sacrifice; adaptability offers immediate survival but can erode identity. Joan&#39;s unwavering faith redefined what women could be across centuries; Mata Hari&#39;s resourcefulness showed what women could accomplish under duress; yet only Joan&#39;s approach left an enduring example beyond her lifetime.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.t168jy8dm8vh"><span class="c34">Joan of Arc, Mata Hari &amp; Diana: Moral Strategies in Hostile Systems</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan of Arc, Mata Hari, and Princess Diana each forged unique paths in societies designed to control women. Their approaches to agency reveal truths about power, authenticity, and survival.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Joan&#39;s power came from unyielding faith and conviction. As a peasant girl claiming divine mission, she transformed gender limitations into spiritual armor, leading with certainty rooted in higher truth. She showed that challenging broken systems demands tremendous sacrifice but offers the possibility of genuine transformation.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Mata Hari built her influence on carefully crafted mystique, turning exotic allure into a tool and using male desire for leverage. Her strategic shapeshifting provided temporary advantage, but at devastating cost: Margaretha Zelle gradually disappeared behind her own creation, sacrificing authentic selfhood for survival.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Diana navigated with genuine compassion and calculated vulnerability. As the &quot;People&#39;s Princess,&quot; she connected by revealing both warmth and wounds. Her openness won hearts but locked her into dependency on public validation, demonstrating how even sincere emotion becomes a trap when boundaries dissolve.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">Their deaths revealed the true cost of their choices. Joan&#39;s execution transformed steadfast conviction into lasting moral authority; her refusal to compromise eventually elevated her from deeply controversial figure to literal saint. Mata Hari faced the firing squad with controlled performance until the end, yet her carefully crafted survival strategy ultimately condemned her. Diana&#39;s fatal pursuit by media she both welcomed and feared captured her life&#39;s central contradiction: vulnerability without boundaries creates inescapable dependencies.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">These women&#39;s stories reveal that true agency demands conviction above all else. While Joan&#39;s path required extreme isolation and martyrdom, it alone created lasting transformation. Tactical flexibility and strategic vulnerability offered temporary advantages to Mata Hari and Diana but ultimately reinforced the very systems they sought to navigate.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">The revolutionary choice, then, is anchoring in unshakable inner conviction despite its costs. Integrity isn&#39;t about perfection, it&#39;s about remaining faithful to what matters most, especially when this stance demands profound sacrifice. Though Joan&#39;s path required surrendering human connection and ultimately life itself, only her approach broke free from the performance trap that consumed both Mata Hari and Diana.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c9">In systems designed to control, conviction is the foundation for agency. The hard lesson from these three extraordinary women is that while flexibility and vulnerability may ease immediate survival, only unwavering faith and inner conviction, despite its terrible price, offers the possibility of real freedom.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c16 c9"></span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c16 c9"></span></p><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.72ipdjhz5v9g"><span class="c24">DEJA VU</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You&rsquo;re on the sofa, a drink in your hand and a TV programme playing out in front of you. You&rsquo;re halfway concentrating on the TV, engaged in a conversation with the person sitting next to you. The door opens and you turn over your shoulder to look. Your friend is in the doorway. &ldquo;Any of you want anything?&rdquo; he asks. Something clicks in your brain - </span><span class="c14">I&rsquo;ve seen this before. Did I dream about this? </span><span>&nbsp;Your sofamate pauses before responding, &ldquo;Are there any chips left?&rdquo; </span><span class="c14">I knew he was going to say that, you think</span><span class="c3">. How is this happening?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It carries out for another 30 seconds - you&rsquo;re experiencing increasing levels of disbelief as an ordinarily mundane conversation plays out in front of you. Slowly, the prescience, the familiar feeling, fades. You tell your friends about your brief brush with the infinite - the fact that you were granted divine foreknowledge of their whole conversation. They seem somewhat underwhelmed, to your consternation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You have just had a bout/case/episode of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Statistically, about 97% of the people reading this are nodding along to this description - recognising this experience (ironically). That means about 3% of readers have missed this wonderful quirk of human existence. For those of you unfamiliar, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, (French for &ldquo;already seen&rdquo;) is a psychological sensation where one feels that they have previously experienced the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c130"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.yqylimln59x8"><span class="c25 c39">ORIGINS OF DEJA VU</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>There are many explanations around the origin of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The one that I find most convincing is that it&rsquo;s a false-positive in the recognition pathway. In normal circumstances, you experience something through your physical senses: your eyes perceive the scene in front of you, and the images get passed to the medial temporal lobe to see if you have experienced this before. This is a pre-conscious step - it happens separate to, and ahead of, your conscious thought/Cartesian observer/homunculus registering what is happening. If you&rsquo;ve seen it before - if it matches the databank of previous observations, the medial temporal lobe gives the scene/person/location a thumbs up - </span><span class="c14">yep, we know this</span><span class="c3">. By this point, your frontal cortex - the conscious, thinking part - kicks in and you&rsquo;re &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of what you&rsquo;re looking at. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But imagine you get a false positive. Your medial temporal lobe passes a positive recognition check back up the pathway - </span><span class="c14">we&rsquo;ve seen this one before</span><span>. Your frontal cortex then watches the scene unfold in front of it, accompanied by a strong sense of familiarity from the medial lobe: </span><span class="c14">I&rsquo;ve seen this before&hellip; therefore I must know what&rsquo;s about to happen, what&rsquo;s about to be said. But how? Maybe I saw it in a dream?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You begin to realise that, familiar or not, you can&rsquo;t predict what&rsquo;s happening and that there&rsquo;s something off about the recognition you feel. After a period of time, usually less than ten seconds, normalcy asserts itself - perhaps the check is repeated in the medial temporal lobe - and the familiarity flag is discarded. But the unsettling feeling can last a lot longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.j3h3xsazmhrm"><span class="c25 c39">RELATED MENTAL PHENOMENON</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Deja vu has a reciprocal.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;A Joker to its Batman. &ldquo;Jamais vu&rdquo; is a complete lack of familiarity experienced when viewing a scene or situation that is known to be familiar. A false-negative in the recognition circuit. A classic example comes in the double-take upon writing a common word that somehow feels&hellip; wrong? It can, in fact, be induced by writing the same word over and over. When you&rsquo;re writing it for the forty-seventh time, it will probably start to feel a little unreal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Jamais vu is less well known, and rightly so - the boundaries of this experience are much harder to define. How can we separate jamais vu from simple forgetfulness? It can also be more easily induced: a simple experiment involves writing out a common word 50 or more times. By the time you get to the end, you&rsquo;ll start to doubt whether the word itself is real. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jamais vu has a bigger brother. This experience in extreme manifests as Capgras delusion. Originally known as the &ldquo;illusion of Doppelgangers&rdquo;, Capgras delusion usually results from traumatic brain injury. In patients with this condition, the familiar feels alien. They become convinced that their loved ones have been replaced by identical clones. In this instance, there is no &ldquo;recognition flag&rdquo; from the medial temporal lobe. They can look at their loved ones and see every quirk, behaviour and action that they expect. But when run against the medial temporal&rsquo;s check - </span><span class="c14">have I seen this before?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- they get no verification. The conclusion is clear - I do not recognise this person. The only logical conclusion is that this is not the person they love but a flawless simulacrum. Capgras&#39; delusion is heartbreaking. Deja vu is harmless. But both come down to some issues in internal wiring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.61ohkdqs8n6g"><span class="c25 c39">ENJOYING THE RIDE</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Everything that happens to us - all our experiences and interactions, and the resulting memories of them - come from electrical signals interpreted by a densely packed bundle of cells wrapped in fat.

Now I seek out. I drink my sodas too quickly, delighting in the opportunity to experience something slightly out-of-the-ordinary.

This mental misfire is a gateway to the concept of our own fallibility. Deja vu is a flaring of the fire, showing us not just the shadows on the cave wall but the puppeteers themselves. We may not be able to process what we&rsquo;ve seen, rendered inarticulate, our mouths flapping dumbly as our conscious mind reaches for words like &ldquo;dream&rdquo;, but for a moment we experience how fragile the whole puppet show is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I personally experience a delightful grab-bag of low-level mental misfires - auditory hallucinations, minor delusions, intermittent face-blindness. As a teenager, I found this highly unsettling. But growing up means making peace with your oddities, and realising your own limitations and fallibility. D&eacute;j&agrave; vu provides the perfect vehicle for understanding this: no one&rsquo;s brain works perfectly all the time. As an unassuming phenomenon, it doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit for its load-bearing nature in daily experience. Having a name for something you have always thought or experienced can be freeing. There&rsquo;s power in being able to say, &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a thing.&rdquo; Like the liberation I felt the first time I encountered the word, &ldquo;solipsism&rdquo;. Now, I try to enjoy these mental misfires and simply delight in their soda-burp nature.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;My brain handing me a quirky diversion from my day for you to enjoy as I please, like flapping my arm around when I&rsquo;ve fallen asleep on it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There are many examples in psychology where we can genuinely believe something to be true, only to later discover that we are incorrect. The Mandela effect, for example (one phenomenon that seems to actually replicate). What d&eacute;j&agrave; vu provides that these other psychological effects do not is that it actually resolves itself through that sense of incorrectness. It is self-sufficient. We pause our own processing for a second and see the still frames that form the movie, only to press play again and carry on as before. You can now say, &ldquo;huh, that was weird&rdquo;, or you can recognise that the edifice on which your whole experience and understanding of the world is built is fragile and teetering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.injan42gcwq1"><span class="c25 c39">A GATEWAY TO THE TRANSCENDENT</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Many people seek out this sense of enlightenment and perspective through hallucinogenic drugs or the supernatural, but the realisation of our size and the scale of the world around us can be achieved through an often-overlooked pedestrian experience. Anyone who has experienced d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, a brief and passing sense that something mundane may be of greater-than-expected importance, should be able to recognise some of the delusions experienced in schizophrenia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Some may call this perspective pessimistic - the idea of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu pulling down the curtain to reveal that it&rsquo;s all a sham. Personally I find that delightful. Magic is only magic if you don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s done. Once you know, it gets a different name, but the magic itself doesn&rsquo;t go away. Which is more impressive, the handkerchief that appears from nowhere, or the months and years of practice to create the showmanship, the misdirection and the dexterity that culminate in the illusion?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As well as its role in understanding ourselves, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu has provided a route to understanding the universe. As a phenomenon, it has always existed on the periphery of the uncanny. Emile Boirac, who gave the experience its name, was what we would call today a &ldquo;parapsychologist&rdquo; - publishing books on the psychic sciences and investigating mediums</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c3">. To many, this pedestrian experience is a weakening of the walls of reality. Rather than it being a glimpse into the workings of consciousness, it represents an opportunity to recognise the vastness of experience. Are we briefly experiencing the memories of our Other Selves, stepping from a parallel universe? Is this a moment of low-level clairvoyance? Are we briefly tapping into the Jungian collective unconscious? Incredible value and outsized performance from a simple brain hiccup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I will leave it to the reader to decide how much merit they give to these more extraordinary experiences. Do these explanations have any more weight than the temporal medial lobe misfire? They are not necessarily mutually exclusive. (And as a disciple of Feyerabend, I would light-heartedly challenge anyone who asserts that one is more &ldquo;objectively true&rdquo; than the other).Why not keep the magic and the hallucinating meat?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anyway, for the purposes of this review, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The point is that d&eacute;j&agrave; vu provides us the option to engage with it on a level that we choose. We can see it as a passing mental misfire - pins and needles of the mind - or we can choose to let it fundamentally change our understanding of the nature of the universe. That is a sort of a revelation that normally requires illegal drugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.p342q37ksaz6"><span class="c25 c39">IMPACT OF DEJA VU ON HUMANITY</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Naturally, an experience of this has had a significant impact on art and culture. The most iconic cultural reference is the Matrix - the idea that we are living in a computer simulation, and that humanity has been through many futile illusory cycles of breaking free from the machine slavery. When Neo sees a black cat walk by twice, he&rsquo;s told it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;glitch in the Matrix&rdquo;&mdash;proof that his world is a computer simulation. D&eacute;j&agrave; vu becomes evidence that reality is fake. Given the fate of humanity in the movie, I&rsquo;m not sure we can call that one optimistic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The influence of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu on humanity could be even more fundamental than explicit or disguised references in art. It is commonly accepted that fashion progresses through repeated cycles, (referenced here: </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170537686&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qGL7pICffT1rrKGbqLxmq">https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/</a></span><span class="c3">) &nbsp;There is nothing new under the sun: each generation reaches back several steps to appropriate previous cultural tropes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nostalgia, the opium of the elderly, is a powerful force, for good or for ill. Proust&rsquo;s madeline provides an articulation of that warm glow of retreating into the familiar. Like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, nostalgia is often an unsought experience, but this time in reference to some that truly has been &ldquo;already seen&rdquo;. Or, if you prefer your involuntary recollections with a darker twist, there is the madeline&rsquo;s evil twin, the ice-bucket shock of an intrusive thought from the past, post-traumatic reliving of a moment that could have gone slightly differently, with disastrous consequences. Even worse, perhaps the past is remembered with perfect clarity - that cruel thing you said once, breaking through your curated image of yourself with incontrovertible evidence that you are not who you wish yourself to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Some of our most affecting experiences as humans, the ones that can reach to the deepest core of who we are, relate to our memories. Do we experience d&eacute;j&agrave; vu because we yearn for the past and our brain is trying too hard to oblige? Or perhaps the reason we are so affected by our recall is because of this error - our brain is used to searching our memories for recognition, and so we respond to this like a pastime?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Is that why it is so easy to be trapped on infinite scroll? We are searching for something we have almost seen before: we are presented the echo chamber we pretend not to want, because of our yearning for stimulus that feels familiar? In comedy, the technique is known as a call-back, a reference to a section from earlier. As a comedian, it&rsquo;s brilliantly economical: you can get multiple laughs from the same joke. It is actually a force-multiplier - the subsequent laughs are bolstered by the warm notion of familiarity. The technique is so powerful that most comedians will end their set on a call-back, knowing that the audience&rsquo;s delight will carry them off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.lke8mj51aw9"><span class="c25 c39">CONCLUSION</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For a tiny day-to day absurdity, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu punches well above its weight - the Singapore of mental mishaps. It gives us an opportunity to ask some of the biggest questions of our species: is there more than what we can see? Is anything we experience real? How do we know what we know? Available in a bitesize format without getting up from the couch, or taking anything stronger than a soda. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Some might find it unsettling that our brains go wrong so easily. I don&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s like seeing the brushstrokes of reality. Knowing how its done only enhances the experience. YOu might not be able to call it magic when you know how the trick is done, but after that it becomes something even more impressive: craft, dedication, practice. The real marvel isn&rsquo;t the trick itself, it&rsquo;s the magician. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.8gzv3rhlcurq"><span class="c25 c39">ENDNOTES:</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>[1] </span><span class="c25 c106">It also has several less interesting siblings, such as d&eacute;j&agrave; entendu, but they do not interest me so I will leave them for you to explore at your leisure</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25 c106">[2] Except sleep paralysis.

The young mother gives birth to a child. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the child is thin, so sickly-thin it hurts to see her. The young mother is told not to nurse her, or name her, so as to lessen the grief when she dies. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She names the girl-child anyway, defiantly and in public. The young mother is angry, and disgusted, at the way the others of the village seem to accept grief and loss placidly, without a teeth-bared snarling fight against the darkness that takes and takes. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child lives in pain, sickly and wracked by fever. She could be cured easily by medicine, but there is no medicine. The little child could cure herself, with enough food, but there is never enough food. The village pities the young mother, for her ill-fortune, and for her commitment to this little sickly thing that will only hurt and die. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mother hatches a plan, a reckless desperate plan. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead of night, she steals to the neighbor village. She brings the girl-child with her, clutched to her chest, lest someone smother her baby thinking themselves kind. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mother creeps through the darkness for hours, barefoot, until she finds the pen where a rich man keeps his cattle. She selects one of these, a leathery, fly-covered specimen, and ties a rope around its neck and leads it away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She returns to the village. She takes a sharp stone in her hand like her grandmother taught her, and punctures the neck-vein of this cow. It bleats in pain and protest, but does not struggle; this is something it has been conditioned to accept. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slurps the blood greedily, hot and raw from the wound, and feeds a few drops to her child. The sickly girl-child does not yet have the iron stomach of an adult Maasai, but she must develop it quickly if she is to survive. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mother walks for hours away from the village, to find a copse of trees where she might hide the cow. It will require constant attention, to keep it fed and hidden, and if her crime is ever discovered she might be killed, or forced to marry the rich man. But for now, there is a plan, a thread of survival stretching into the future. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c25 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bares her bloody teeth against the darkness, in defiance and threat. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c26 c14">I will keep you safe</span><span class="c26">, she declares to the child in her arms. </span><span class="c26 c14">No matter what</span><span class="c25 c26">. </span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she holds me tight. </span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"># </span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c33 c17 c26 c14">[Thoughtgram ends] </span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">X: Wow. </span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&zeta;: And then a year later I die of fucking malaria, for no reason!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Like...what??</span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">X: Yeah. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c26 c14">[Reluctant acknowledgement] </span><span class="c2">There have been a lot of balance complaints about rural Africa.

Einstein wrote quite extensively about the issues of his day and, as I hope to show, those writings are interesting in their own right. The period between 1905 when Einstein, at the age of 26, first came to global fame after making numerous scientific discoveries in &nbsp;what&rsquo;s been termed his &ldquo;miracle year&rdquo;, and his death in 1955 is perhaps the most eventful 50-year period ever in history, encompassing events such as:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_dzqxpb381c1q-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">WW1 and WW2</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The adoption of mass public education in the West</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The Great Depression</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The founding of Israel as a state</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The rise of the Nazi party</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The Russian Revolution and the establishment of the USSR</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The Holocaust</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The development of nuclear weapons and the MAD doctrine</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The start of the Cold War</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Mass adoption of radios, television, and the advent of mass media</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Rapid scientific and technological advances</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Einstein commented on these events with a rare clarity and scope of thought, and was even personally involved in several of them. His thoughts are certainly of historical interest and many still hold relevance to contemporary issues. At the very least they&rsquo;re a worthwhile glimpse into the broader worldview of arguably history&rsquo;s greatest mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Broadly Einstein held progressive attitudes; advocating pacifism, global cooperation, socialism, animal welfare and independence of thought; and opposing nationalism, militarism, authoritarianism, intellectual authority and coercion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;d like to cover the details of his views in five main subject areas, evaluate how coherent his reasoning was and comment on how his vision for the world has held up from a modern perspective. </span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.i0ahtor887o8"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">School and Academia &nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>If anyone was ever qualified to have an opinion on the best way to foster intellectual development, it must be Einstein, and his opinion of the approach taken by the mainstream education system of his time was very dim. Einstein was critical of the autocratic nature of schools and the lack of freedom they imposed on students, as well as the over-emphasis on rote learning. He advocated for self-directed learning guided by curiosity, which he considered formal education an impediment to: &quot;</span><span class="c14">It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.</span><span class="c3">&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Einstein was also very wary of groupthink and received dogma: &quot;</span><span class="c14">A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth.</span><span class="c3">&quot;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">He considered academia to have a similar tendency to stifle originality, independence of thought, and creativity. He thought social fashions, credentialization, formal hierarchies, and the intrusion of money, prestige, and other external social forces to be negative influences on personal intellectual development&mdash;going so far as to suggest that prospective scientists should isolate themselves from mainstream society and study in solitary occupations such as being a lighthouse keeper.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Einstein had an exceptionally idiosyncratic ideal of how learning should be structured, perhaps unsurprisingly given the exceptional and idiosyncratic nature of genius.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">I don&#39;t know how realistic an approach like Einstein suggests would be for the entire population of learners; probably without explicit standards and incentives, some students and academics would achieve less.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">But I do agree with Einstein that a formalized system has the potential to stifle some of the rare and extremely valuable students with the potential for scientific genius. I think it&#39;s a missed opportunity that modern society doesn&#39;t deliberately provide any social roles of the kind Einstein proposed in the hope of cultivating geniuses, and instead forces all prospective scientists through the same institutional monoculture.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Modern schools and academia are still very much formalized institutions, and the intrusion of the external social world on intellectual pursuits in the form of career incentives and prevailing ideologies has not lessened. I&rsquo;m inclined to view Einstein&#39;s diagnosis as prescient and still very much relevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.cy42zmr65fpm"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39"></span></h2><h2 class="c45" id="h.j1oc9br10n3c"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Zionism</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Having spent a fair amount of time studying Einstein&rsquo;s ideas in my physics degree, one thing that I don&rsquo;t think was ever mentioned, but that is very prominent in his writings, is that Einstein and many of the other great physicists of the era were Jewish, often knew each other personally, and related to each other as Jews.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Einstein took pride in being Jewish describing the features of Jewish tradition he particularly admired as</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;&quot;The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, an almost fanatical love of justice, and the desire for personal independence.&quot; </span><span>That affinity only grew after persecution of Jews heightened in Germany, he said: </span><span class="c14">&quot;My relationship to the Jewish people has become my strongest human bond, ever since I became fully aware of our precarious position among the nations of the world.&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And on his travels often preferred to stay with local Jewish enclaves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>He supported creating a Jewish homeland to escape persecution but also to preserve Jewish identity,</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span>which he saw </span><span class="c14">as &ldquo;rooted in a common historical tradition, in a common cultural possession.&quot;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>He traveled to Palestine to show support for Zionism. &nbsp;On visiting Tel Aviv he complemented the city&rsquo;s economic and intellectual life, attributing it to &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">What an incredibly lively people our Jews are!</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Before the establishment of Israel as a state a wide spectrum of Zionist thought existed with different visions of what Israel should be. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The specific branch of Zionism, cultural Zionism, that Einstein supported was on the left of that spectrum, and envisioned a future Israel that acted only as a secular hub for sustaining Jewish culture and the Hebrew language that might be lost among international Jews who integrated into gentile societies. It also envisioned an Israel that wasn&rsquo;t its own state but that could provide a refuge for persecuted Jews around the world, as well as advocating cooperation and cohabitation with Arabs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Einstein rejected aspirations of constructing Israel as the kind of state it has become &quot;</span><span class="c14">with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power</span><span class="c3">&quot; and opposed plans for mass resettlement of Jews in Arab lands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After Israel was established as a state Einstein did continue to support it, and was even offered the presidency, but was critical of Israeli nationalism and militarism as well as the treatment of Palestinians. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">One question that is often asked about Einstein&#39;s Zionism is did this support for Israel as it actually exists contradict his general opposition to nationalism and militarism? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The Israel that was eventually created was not the Israel Einstein advocated for, in that sense I don&rsquo;t think Einstein is liable for any faults Israel might have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">However, the international system is precarious for any nation, particularly one in the Middle East. I don&rsquo;t know how realistic it was to think Israel could durably persist as a cultural centre, without a military or state apparatus. Presumably it did occur to Einstein that an Israel with a military and state, maybe even an expansionist one, was a likely outcome of the Zionist project as a whole. That possibility didn&rsquo;t deter Einstein from Zionism, and his continued, albeit limited, support for Israel after it gained statehood does suggest he viewed that possibility as preferable to not creating any kind of Jewish home-land at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I also think Einstein had a tribal affinity with other Jews that was at least somewhat at odds with his cosmopolitanism, sometimes even bordering on chauvinism. Einstein was not religiously Jewish, so it was an affinity, based on culture or ethnicity, of the same kind that nationalism is built on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But of course in the context of Jewish persecution, it was a kind of proto-nationalism that was defensive, at least initially, rather than the aggressive expansionist kind of nationalism that Einstein particularly opposed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Overall I think Einstein&#39;s stance on Zionism was more reasonable than principled, and I&rsquo;m less impressed with his foresight and high-mindedness on this issue than on some others. But I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a major departure from his broader values and I&rsquo;m interested in what an Israel that was more influenced by Einstein&#39;s thought might have been like. </span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.bi3993gng7iv"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Cosmopolitanism</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Einstein held a life-long opposition to nationalism, describing it as an &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">infantile disease.</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; Early in life he disliked the jingoism of the German education system, and understandably felt alienated by German nationalism as a Jew. After the world wars his opposition to nationalism only strengthened as he considered it to have been a cause of the conflicts. A view that complemented his pacifism. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">His attitudes towards ethnicity were perhaps more changeable over his life. His writings from before WW2, have been described as xenophobic and are maybe more open to the possibility of innate racial traits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In 1922 Einstein embarked on a half-year voyage to give scientific lectures and meet with public figures around the world. He visited China, Japan, India, Palestine and Spain, and kept diaries detailing his perceptions of the local cultures. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Concerning poverty in China he commented that the Chinese were being </span><span class="c14">&ldquo;punished for their fecundity</span><span>&rdquo; referring to overpopulation, but also that &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">Even those reduced to working like horses never give the impression of conscious suffering.&rdquo; </span><span>He was also concerned that the Chinese might come to &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">supplant every other nation through their diligence, frugality, and abundance of offspring</span><span>&rdquo;, a possibility he considered &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">unspeakably dreary</span><span>&rdquo; because the Chinese were more spiritless than other races, </span><span class="c33 c44 c14">&ldquo;a peculiar hard-like nation.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Later in life he was more clearly opposed to racism. After moving to America, following the Nazi&rsquo;s rise to power in Germany in 1933, he gave public speeches and wrote several articles denouncing segregation, describing himself as &ldquo;</span><span class="c33 c44 c14">strongly against this injustice to the colored people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He summarized the arguments of segregationist as:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c14">&ldquo;Our attitude towards Negroes is the result of unfavorable experiences which we have had by living side by side with Negroes in this country. They are not our equals in intelligence, sense of responsibility, reliability.</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>And responded that their &ldquo;</span><span class="c33 c44 c14">ancestors dragged these black people from their homes by force; and in the white man&rsquo;s quest for wealth and an easy life they have been ruthlessly suppressed and exploited, degraded into slavery. The modern prejudice against Negroes is the result of the desire to maintain this unworthy condition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And that the Classical Greeks held similar prejudices against their white slaves, and also that racial prejudice was &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">conditioned by opinions and emotions which we unconsciously absorb as children from our environment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Later in life, particularly after WW2 and the Holocaust, Einstein consciously rejected arguments based on innate racial traits that he might have entertained earlier in his life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This might be the issue where Einstein&#39;s views were most in accord with what has become common opinion. I think it&rsquo;s easy for his opinion to come across as banal or unremarkable to a modern audience, and I think modern instantiations of these ideas sometimes verge on the kind of received wisdom that Einstein railed against. So I&rsquo;m not sure how much direct insight Einstein can provide here. But I also think he deserves credit for adopting more humanistic attitudes early, and I think it&rsquo;s an issue where he was ahead of his time. </span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.lkwvyzhlaoi8"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Nuclear Weapons</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&ldquo;The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c44 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nuclear weapons appear to have been among the issues Einstein cared most about, perhaps only second to the Nazi persecution of Jews, going so far as to advocate a world government to prevent conflict between nuclear-armed nations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He opposed building nuclear weapons in almost every instance when many other physicists, such as Von Neuman, and the political establishment in the US favoured their construction to further political aims, even when Einstein might have been sympathetic to those aims.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Einstein did of course sign the famous Einstein&ndash;Szil&aacute;rd Letter urging the US to develop nuclear weapons before Nazi Germany could, but later regretted signing it after it transpired that the Nazis were not close to developing their own weapons, stating that &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would never have lifted a finger.</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It has been argued that because Einstein countenanced building nuclear weapons in WW2 that his later opposition to American developments of nuclear weapons in the early Cold War, and he was even accused of Soviet sympathies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>But that was a situation where nuclear weapons were perceived as possibly the difference between outright victory or defeat against Germany, and his later regrets suggest that he wouldn&rsquo;t have considered the shortening of an already </span><span>forgon</span><span class="c3">e war enough justification for what he saw as the inherent evil of nuclear weapons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I think you can infer that he viewed the difference in moral legitimacy between the US and USSR in the Cold War to be less than the difference between the US and Germany in WW2. But also that he held a consistently principled near total opposition to nuclear weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of that near total opposition. On the one hand nukes are obviously terrifying things that, all else equal, the world would be better without. On the other hand, with hindsight the nuclear devastation that Einstein was worried about just didn&rsquo;t happen, and there&rsquo;s the argument that the MAD doctrine has deterred conventional war. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Strictly speaking I think Einstein did overestimate the risk posed by nuclear weapons, but at the time a cautious approach was warranted with the information available. And the several near-disasters that occurred throughout the Cold War might suggest that we just happen to live in a lucky timeline and that really the risks were very high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just sidestepping the game theory of containing nukes completely or asking states to disarm unilaterally, like Einstein seems to have wanted to do, seems hopelessly unrealistic. As does the expectation that states like the US and USSR should not make use of them for political aims, and his proposed world government.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But ultimately, with any issue of existential importance I don&rsquo;t think any view can be condemned for being too optimistic or naive. And I admire Einstein&#39;s insistence that the political conflicts of the Cold War, on either side, didn&rsquo;t matter enough to justify the risks, like political leaders of the time implicitly must have thought. </span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.nx3x6k9g0pwk"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Socialism </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The central divide in socialist thought in the first half of the 20th century was between forms of socialism that were more tolerant of autocracy and more sympathetic to the USSR and forms that were more liberal and more democratic. Einstein came down strongly on the liberal democratic side of the debate and favoured incremental reform over revolution, implicitly preferring to retain much of the existing social framework of liberal capitalist society. In that sense he was not as radically anti-capitalist as some other intellectuals of the time, such as Sartre, who openly favoured the USSR over the West. But Einstein still held views that placed him firmly on the left of the political spectrum. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the essay </span><span class="c14">Why Socialism</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;he lists his main objections to the then-existing capitalist economy as:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_a08kktv5f9kn-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Capitalism allowed income to be gained through the ownership of property, that income could in turn be reinvested into acquiring more property leading to an even larger stream of income which could be invested into yet more property. That feedback loop allowed established capitalists to expand their portfolio over time without limit, and the capitalist class as a whole to appropriate an ever expanding proportion of national wealth and income. Without sufficient redistribution Einstein suspected that such a run-away feedback loop would eventually reduce the share of national income of workers to the lowest possible level, the level of subsistence wages he had witnessed among peasants in China and India. </span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_a08kktv5f9kn-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span>He feared capitalism limited intellectual freedom and prevented honest discussion of alternative systems because capitalists inevitably come to control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information including the press, radio and the education system, making it &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">extremely difficult [...] for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</span><span>&rdquo; He also insinuates that academic economics was under some degree of influence by capital and likened economists to priests of the medieval church who &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior.</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_a08kktv5f9kn-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Capitalists might come to directly influence or control political parties themselves. </span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_a08kktv5f9kn-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Capitalist economies are anarchic and uncoordinated leading to inefficiency and waste lowering growth.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_a08kktv5f9kn-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span>Capitalism eroded social trust and bonds. Einstein thought that individuals are necessarily dependent on the wider community and the division of labour to provide their economic means because no single person can run an industrialized economy alone, but that capitalism attempted to obscure this fact by providing an illusory form of individualism and caused people to view this dependency as a threat to their individual rights and prosperity rather than an &ldquo;organic tie&rdquo;, or as a &ldquo;protective force&rdquo;, which he considers a healthier, more pro-social and more accurate view of the individual&#39;s place in large-scale industrial society. Einstein described capitalism as part of the &ldquo;predatory stage&rdquo; of civilization and thought that for a man who lives by competition in the market the &ldquo;</span><span class="c33 c44 c14">egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate.&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c44 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The reforms Einstein proposed to remedy those issues consisted of:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_6zu74cz9rxye-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Collective ownership of the means of production so that the gains from capital accumulation could accrue to the population as a whole rather than private owners of capital. </span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_6zu74cz9rxye-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Replacing coordination of the economy by the market with centralised planning so that the economy could grow in a more orderly and efficient manner. </span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_6zu74cz9rxye-0"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Replacing an education system focused on competition for economic station with one that was orientated towards &ldquo;social goals&rdquo;. Presumably social goals in line with his thinking around pro-social tendencies and fostering personal development and intellectual ability. </span></li></ul><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He also stipulated that the kind of democratic-socialism that this would result in should be run without an all-powerful or overweening bureaucracy that should also protect individual rights and be democratic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">How well-thought-out is this view of socialism? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">One criticism might be that his proposed remedies aren&rsquo;t very substantial and he doesn&#39;t provide much detail on exactly how to create a bureaucracy that&rsquo;s large enough to run the economy more efficiently but not so overbearing as to become tyrannical. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nor does he give any technical proposal on how to ensure it actually does run the economy more efficiently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Einstein himself would probably agree with that criticism, he described those problems as &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">extremely difficult socio-political problems</span><span>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Einstein clearly saw solving those technical problems as something to be left to others and his own role as bringing the issue to attention and reducing the taboo around the subject. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Einstein&#39;s views about how individuals should come to terms with their dependency on society and that they should accept that relationship as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; or &ldquo;protective&rdquo; leave me a little ill at ease, because they do seem at odds with personal autonomy. But equally, modern society has certainly swung in an individualist direction since 1955, and has seen rising social atomisation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I also think it is true that the interdependent and global nature of modern economic production does undermine the notion of a self-reliant individual that deserves everything he has on account of his personal productivity that is very much a part of the current zeitgeist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Socialism overall has lost popularity since Einstein&rsquo;s death, and is not generally seen to have been vindicated by the economic trends of the second half of the 20th century. So you might say his ideas have not stood the test of time well. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But the more moderate variety that he promoted has fared better than the more autocratic kind. And I do find his formulation of the problem of private capital accumulation and his views on the tendency for institutions to be influenced by private interests persuasive, as well as his opinion that education should not be too intertwined with the market economy. So I think those ideas still hold value. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.vwx2me5nd5kj"><span class="c33 c51 c8 c39">Final Thoughts</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&ldquo;In the case of every problem that is not purely technical, even the most brilliant scientific approach will not help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I hope I&rsquo;ve shown that there is depth to Einstein&rsquo;s world-view, but I think it can be interpreted as naively idealistic. Cultural Zionism, world government, democratic socialism, cosmopolitanism, education reform and animal rights are all visions for the future where issues are resolved through more cooperation and empathy,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;without hard tradeoffs being made, without much regard for vested interests or existing incentive structures, and which don&rsquo;t entail any use of force. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And you might think that he lacked foresight about the trends of the post-WW2 world, given that socialism saw little success, Israel did become a nationalist state with a military and that nuclear war never happened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I have a more charitable interpretation: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For one thing, given Einstein&#39;s intelligence and the level of engagement with the issues he must have been aware of more cynical view points. The opinions he expressed in his writings are the views he advocated publicly, not all the views that he considered but rejected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>But more importantly Einstein thought that </span><span class="c14">&ldquo;Politics is more difficult than physics.&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">and that theories in social science couldn&rsquo;t have the same predictive power as theories in hard sciences. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Whilst he did consider issues deeply and with a lot of insight, predicting which social trends will predominate over the long term, or in which ways the world will improve and which ways it will stay the same is probably close to impossible, even for a genius. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t think a less idealistic version of Einstein could have made better prescriptions, nor do I think there were other thinkers from the time period, other scientists or dedicated social theorists, offering more accurate total world-views. On single issues, yes, but not total world-views. I agree with Einstein that even being a genius just doesn&rsquo;t get you that much predictive power in the social sciences. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Einstein mixed his analysis in with a heuristic of just being nice whenever possible and not letting realism become an excuse for Machiavellianism or hubris. And I think that served him well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If the future is uncertain, just being generally cooperative is a good strategy, from the point of view of the world as a whole. A more calculating political actor who would pursue political goals through conflict or force, or who was willing to make calculated trade-offs would be in a worse position if the world evolved unpredictably than one who was just straightforwardly beneficent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Einstein considered the hard sciences to have outpaced social science and social progress, and that</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;&ldquo;our technology has exceeded our humanity.&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">I think there was an empirical component to his idea of social progress and also a component of simply increasing altruism and cooperation that he viewed as at least as important as the empirical side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Overall rating for Einstein&#39;s world-view: 8/10</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.dr8de8qd19np"><span class="c24">Effective Altruism &amp; Rationalism</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 333.50px; height: 259.21px;"><img alt="" src="images/image89.png" style="width: 333.50px; height: 259.21px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Some 3000 indigenous S&aacute;mi people have dibs on around 40% of non-industrialised Norway to practice reindeer husbandry, sometimes to the annoyance of those among the 5.5 million Norwegians who would prefer to use the land for other purposes. </span></p><p class="c7"><span>Norway&rsquo;s energy directorate kicked off a bitter dispute by allowing 151 wind turbines to shoot up in a winter grazing area of two S&aacute;mi </span><span class="c14">siidas</span><span class="c3">, with the Supreme Court ruling it a human rights violation in 2021.

Hard historicism sees current or new power structures as inevitable, and making it futile to fight or change them. Soft historicism knows the ultimate aim of society, and so will look to realise it:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">The Utopian approach may be described as follows. Any rational action must have a certain aim. It is rational in the same degree as it pursues its aim consciously and consistently, and as it determines its means according to this end. To choose the end is therefore the first thing we have to do if we wish to act rationally; and we must be careful to determine our real or ultimate ends, from which we must distinguish clearly those intermediate or partial ends which actually are only means, or steps on the way, to the ultimate end. If we neglect this distinction, then we must also neglect to ask whether these partial ends are likely to promote the ultimate end, and accordingly, we must fail to act rationally. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">These principles, if applied to the realm of political activity, demand that we must determine our ultimate political aim, or the Ideal State, before taking any practical action. Only when this ultimate aim is determined, in rough outline at least, only when we are in possession of something like a blueprint of the society at which we aim, only then can we begin to consider the best ways and means for its realization, and to draw up a plan for practical action. These are the necessary preliminaries of any practical political move that can be called rational, and especially of social engineering. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">He contrasts the Utopian approach with &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; social engineering, </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">the method of searching for, and fighting against, the greatest and most urgent evils of society, rather than searching for, and fighting for, its greatest ultimate good.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">In favour of his method, the piecemeal engineer can claim that a systematic fight against suffering and injustice and war is more likely to be supported by the approval and agreement of a great number of people than the fight for the establishment of some ideal. The existence of social evils, that is to say, of social conditions under which many men are suffering, can be comparatively well established. Those who suffer can judge for themselves, and the others can hardly deny that they would not like to change places. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">It is infinitely more difficult to reason about an ideal society. Social life is so complicated that few men, or none at all, could judge a blueprint for social engineering on the grand scale; whether it be practicable; whether it would result in a real improvement; what kind of suffering it may involve; and what may be the means for its realization. </span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c14">As opposed to this, blueprints for piecemeal engineering are comparatively simple. They are blueprints for single institutions, for health and unemployed insurance, for instance, or arbitration courts, or anti-depression budgeting, or educational reform. If they go wrong, the damage is not very great, and a re-adjustment not very difficult. They are less risky, and for this very reason less controversial. But if it is easier to reach a reasonable agreement about existing evils and the means of combating them than it is about an ideal good and the means of its realization, then there is also more hope that by using the piecemeal method we may get over the very greatest practical difficulty of all reasonable political reform, namely, the use of reason, instead of passion and violence, in executing the programme. There will be a possibility of reaching a reasonable compromise and therefore of achieving the improvement by democratic methods. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">EA is open to both Utopian and piecemeal social engineers.

Naive utilitarianism is authoritarian, dangerously so with plus or minus infinity on one side of the ethics equation. But those critics mix descriptive and normative claims. Dangerous ideas can be true, and blocking our ears is no way to tackle important issues.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Crucially, Popper is making a pragmatic political point:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c14">It is important to understand this criticism properly; I do not criticize the ideal by claiming that an ideal can never be realized, that it must always remain a Utopia. This would not be a valid criticism, for many things have been realized which have once been dogmatically declared to be unrealizable, for instance&hellip;</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c14">What I criticize under the name Utopian engineering recommends the reconstruction of society as a whole, i.e. very sweeping changes whose practical consequences are hard to calculate, owing to our limited experiences. It claims to plan rationally for the whole of society, although we do not possess anything like the factual knowledge which would be necessary to make good such an ambitious claim.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>For Popper, the first priority must always be to protect the liberal institutions that uphold democracy. Kill them to implement a Big Idea, and you take away society&rsquo;s ability to improve (possibly </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-lock-in%23:~:text%3DValue%2520lock%252Din%2520is%2520a,can%2520no%2520longer%2520be%2520altered.&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170611744&amp;usg=AOvVaw0a0811mi29nJjjlTDBUQuL">forever</a></span><span class="c3">). Fight big ideas and play by the rules, and you help society incrementally advance towards a better world.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>EA&rsquo;s first-principles result-oriented thinking leaves no automatic respect for democratic processes or institutions. It goes back to the motte and bailey: The only-a-question ideology places your own political ambitions with the good and the true, exactly the </span><span class="c14">historicist </span><span>allure that foster disregard for democratic norms.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">For global heath (and other hands-on areas) it&rsquo;s ok because it&#39;s kind of true: Do the RCTs, then do what works best. For more speculative interventions, you have to build a case for higher expected QALYs than cash transfers and malaria nets. You measure the results, staying grounded in a reality feedback loop.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>For politics, it&rsquo;s cheating. If you have the good and true answers, you should optimise to implement them, and following the rules may hold you back. With the fate of the world at play, you should </span><span class="c14">really </span><span class="c3">stop at nothing to implement them, even if hard evidence is difficult to come by. Final warnings from Popper:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">The Utopian engineer will have to be deaf to many complaints; in fact, it will be part of his business to suppress unreasonable objections.

It was the one Graham Hancock wrote about in Fingerprints Of The Gods, sort of a modern update on the Atlantis story. It went something like this:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_zh2t6uc5xrb9-0 start"><li class="c7 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Did you know that dozens of civilizations around the world have oddly similar legends about a lost continent that sunk under the waves? The Greeks called it Atlantis; the Aztecs, Atzlan; the Indonesians, Atala.</span></li><li class="c7 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Various ancient structures and artifacts appear to be older than generally believed. Geologists say that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx prove it must be at least 10,000 years old; some well-known ruins in South America have depictions of animals that have been extinct for at least 10,000 years.</span></li><li class="c7 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c33 c44 c14">There are vast underwater ruins, pyramids and stuff. We know where they are! You can just learn to scuba dive and go see them! Historians just ignore them, or say they&rsquo;re probably natural, but if you look at them, they&rsquo;re obviously not natural.</span></li></ul><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Teenage me was impressed by these arguments. But he also had some good instincts and wanted to check to see what skeptics had to say in response. Here are what the skeptics had to say:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_gtm4eorp1qp6-0 start"><li class="c7 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&ldquo;Haha, can you believe some people still think there was an Atlantis!

The ONLY reason you could ever believe it is because you&rsquo;re a racist who thinks brown people couldn&rsquo;t have built civilizations on their own.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c7 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c33 c44 c14">&ldquo;No mainstream historians believe in any of that. Do you think you&rsquo;re smarter than all the world&rsquo;s historians?&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span>Teenage Scott was wrong </span><span class="c14">because</span><span>&nbsp;he really tried to figure out the truth instead of trusting vibes in an information asymmetric landscape. </span><span class="c14">Even while desperately seeking out good counterarguments</span><span class="c3">, he found only vibe-based condescension on the anti-Atlantis side, with no plausible counter-explanations. He knew much more than anyone he could find that disagreed with him, yet he was wrong and went on a five-year wild-goose-chase before recovering. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Grown-up Scott told the story to defend why he spent 25,000 words to fight a similar ivermectin information asymmetry. I endorse that project. But notice the mixed moral of this story.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Rationalism is about winning, and the vibers won the Atlantis question.

Scientists have access to general knowledge and internal error-correcting mechanisms that filter what is worth investigating. If it&rsquo;s not really worth looking into, then no one, or, in the worst case, only those lacking that knowledge, will write about the topic. Media relies on established scientists. </span><span class="c14">When the system works</span><span class="c3">, we&rsquo;re left with an Atlantis-style asymmetry. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">We shouldn&rsquo;t blindly trust the mainstream, but it is an epistemic lifeline: Lose your grip, and pilot unanchored through an unbounded idea space, with no limit to how wrong you can be.

FOX will sometimes present news in a biased or misleading way, but they won&rsquo;t make up news events that never happen. Experts will sometimes prevent studies they don&rsquo;t like from happening, but they&rsquo;re much less likely to flatly assert a clear, specific fact which isn&rsquo;t true.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">I think some people are able to figure out these rules and feel comfortable with them, and other people can&rsquo;t and end up as conspiracy theorists.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">I&rsquo;m not blaming the second type of person. Figuring-out-the-rules-of-the-game is a hard skill, not everybody has it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ok, so if you don&rsquo;t have it you should trust the mainstream, right?</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">If you don&rsquo;t have it, then universal distrust might be a safer strategy than universal credulity.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">What?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This strikes me as a paranoid flattening of the landscape. Like putting cash under your bed instead of the stock market for fear of speculating. The market may be skewed, but index funds always win in the end. Scott continues:</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Obviously the good solution is that people stop lying and presenting misleading information.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">But I think it&rsquo;s important for these two types of people to understand each other.</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c33 c44 c14">The people who lack this skill entirely think it&rsquo;s crazy to listen to experts about anything at all. They correctly point out time after time that they&rsquo;ve lied or screwed up, then ask &ldquo;so why do you believe them on ivermectin?&rdquo; or &ldquo;so why do you believe them on global warming?&rdquo; My answer - which I don&rsquo;t think is an obvious or easy answer, it&rsquo;s a bold claim that could be wrong, is &ldquo;I think I have a good sense of the dynamics here, how far people will bend the truth, and what it looks like when they do&rdquo;. I realize this is playing with fire. But listening to experts is a powerful enough hack for finding the truth that it&rsquo;s worth going pretty far to try to rescue it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">He reversed my logic. Instead of seeing digression from the mainstream as risky, he sees trusting the mainstream as playing with fire: By default, you should distrust everything. But tentatively, carefully, and selectively you can trust the experts sometimes. </span></p><p class="c7"><span>Scott&rsquo;s </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-media-very-rarely-lies&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170633542&amp;usg=AOvVaw37JY4CTiQUtMax836lEQS_">media complaint</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is similarly flattening: He shows how mainstream and alternative media misdirection is similar, with no mention of the mainstream&rsquo;s overwhelming incentive advantage of a diverse audience and lots of (correcting) competitors.

As a journalist, I find his ramblings embarrassingly out of touch with how media and the information market works. The main driver of technical imprecision isn&rsquo;t malice, it&rsquo;s compressing the facts into something readers understand. Journalists have some great and some less great epistemic incentives, and compete with each other to square them best. Zvi is incentivised to give fancy and convincing-sounding hot takes, but receives limited real world feedback to ensures he isn&#39;t living in the clouds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">The rationalist criticism is ironic. The sophisticates who could have improved mainstream debate complain about the quality of public discourse in their own private forum. Instead of improving shared institutions, the rationalist response is to retreat cowardly into clubs of epistemic snobs that self-categorise as Scott&rsquo;s figured-out-the-rules-of-the-game savvys.

The story went like this:</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">SpaceX wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the appearance of failure, which meant that they could learn faster by carrying out tests that might not work.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Everybody at SpaceX was the cream of the crop and held to high expectations in a hard-charging environment.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Decisions were made based on &ldquo;first principles&rdquo;. There was little stifling process and procedure.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">All of this was instantiated through a process of Responsible Engineering. If you were the Responsible Engineer for the pneumatic system, you had absolute power over it, but (hypothetically) any failure on it was your fault. Your capital-R responsibility stretched the whole way - identifying what the pneumatic system was supposed to do, working with all of its stakeholders to individually identify the possible ways it could help or hurt other problems, and finding solutions to every problem.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">If there was a great engineer responsible for each thing, the barriers were moved out of their way, and you got to test and fail until you succeeded, the company would win.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">To a twenty-three year old engineer, this all seemed so obviously right that it was mystifying to me why anybody had done anything any differently.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">When The Algorithm arrived - fresh off the presses of Elon&rsquo;s crushing experience increasing production rate at Tesla - it at first felt unsurprising.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">In essence - as a exasperated reader might have noticed - it was a distillation of various extremely canonical Good Engineering Advice.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Question the Requirements - so you solve exactly and only the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Delete the part - became removing complexity makes problems more manageable.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Optimize the part - good, but only after satisfying the first two.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Accelerate - to get more production and enable test, but only once you know it&rsquo;s the right thing to produce.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c17 c26">&bull;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Automate - ditto, and ditto.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">All of us seemed to read it as such. We nodded thoughtfully and continued along in the way that people since time immemorial have listened to, but not really absorbed, Good Engineering Advice. But slowly, it became clear that this time was different.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">As I worked in the early 2020s, the Algorithm became a mantra around the office. It came up in presentations and one on ones. Our slides were practically required to mention the steps. Within a year, I could recite it when woken from a dead sleep. Steadily, it became clear that this wasn&rsquo;t advice, it was something new.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">Questioning the requirements was an extremely literal thing that you were supposed to do multiple times every single day. I&rsquo;d make a claim about my system (&ldquo;hey, if the stuff in this tube gets too hot, my part will explode, so please don&rsquo;t put anything too hot near it&rdquo;) and </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">that very afternoon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;three or four people would stop by my desk, ready to debate.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; they would say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Responsible Engineer for the Hot Things Near Tubes system,&rdquo; and then the floodgates would open. What did I mean by near? What did I mean by hot? How hot was </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">too</span><span class="c17 c26">&nbsp;hot? Was it really going to </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">explode</span><span class="c17 c26">? If it exploded, was that really </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">so</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;terrible?</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The first time, the debate would be interesting. The second, it would be a bit tiresome. By the first week after a new claim, it was exhausting and a little rote. But you had to win, every time, because if you didn&rsquo;t, nobody would follow your requirement.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">It also worked in the other direction. I learned to pay attention to everything that was happening in the whole program, absorbing dozens of update emails a day, because people would announce Requirements, and I&rsquo;d need to go Question Them. If I didn&rsquo;t do this, I&rsquo;d find my system forced to jump through too many hoops to work, and, of course, I would be Responsible. If I was Responsible for too many things, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to support all of them - unless, of course, I managed to Delete the Part and free myself from one of those burdens.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And so when there were requirements, they were strong, because they had to survive an endless barrage of attack. When there were parts, they were well-justified, because every person involved in the process of making them had tried to delete them first. And there were no requirements matrices, no engineering standards, practically no documentation at all.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">The key point came in, the reason why it was capitalized. It wasn&rsquo;t philosophy, it wasn&rsquo;t advice - it was an </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">Algorithm</span><span class="c2">. A set of process steps that you followed to be a good engineer. And all of us good engineers were being forced by unstoppable cultural forces to maniacally follow it.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">There was one question slowly building in my mind. The point of SpaceX was to get good engineers, do first principles analysis, let them iterate, and avoid documentation. This whole process was clearly succeeding at the last three steps. But if we were already so great, why did we have to have this process enforced so agressively?</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">As the time went on and the Algorithm grew, screaming ever-louder about what we should specifically do, the question grew more ever more urgent.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Tell people to ritualize Questioning Requirements and they will do so ritually. You&rsquo;ll deliver the same explanation for how hot your tube can be a hundred times, and each time you deliver it you think about it less. You will realize that the best way to get work done is to build a persona as extremely knowledgeable and worthless to question, and then nobody ever questions your work.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Tell people to Delete the Part, and they&rsquo;ll have the system perform ridiculous gymnastics in software to avoid making a 30$ bracket, or waste performance to avoid adding a process.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Tell people to Optimize the Part and they&rsquo;ll push it beyond margins unnecessarily, leaving it exquisite at one thing and hopeless at others.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Tell them to Accelerate, and they&rsquo;ll do a great job of questioning, but when push comes to shove they will always Accelerate at the cost of quality or rework, and so you find yourself building vehicles and then scrapping them, over and over again.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">There is no step for Test in the Algorithm, no step for &ldquo;prove it works.&rdquo; And so years went by where we Questioned, and Deleted, and Optimized, and Accelerated, and Automated, and rockets piled up outside the factory and between mid-2021 and mid-2023 they never flew.</span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 420.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image134.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 420.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c19 c17 c26"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bing.com/images/search?view%3DdetailV2%26ccid%3DEpuNfyYv%26id%3DA813CCFC180959A50D806DD2B1AFAC67168DFC71%26thid%3DOIP.EpuNfyYvfeSPmF5nIdxbWQHaFF%26mediaurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.wereldreizigers.nl%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F04%252Fstarbase-spacex-boca-chica-texas-01-2400x1648.jpg%26cdnurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fth.bing.com%252Fth%252Fid%252FR.129b8d7f262f7de48f985e6721dc5b59%253Frik%253DcfyNFmesr7HSbQ%2526pid%253DImgRaw%2526r%253D0%26exph%3D1648%26expw%3D2400%26q%3Dspacex%2Bstarships%2Band%2Bboosters%2Boutside%2Bstarbase%26simid%3D608026460939553977%26FORM%3DIRPRST%26ck%3D824D52D5DAA117E6A67FBA7CC6433E39%26selectedIndex%3D9%26itb%3D0%26cw%3D1343%26ch%3D765%26mode%3Doverlay&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170655057&amp;usg=AOvVaw09qXyWlSO-mSFqfdc8sPHr">Source</a></span><span class="c2">. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Amidst it all, in this approach there is no horrible documentation, but that means that new REs cycling into the program make the same mistakes as the previous ones, and as the RE for your system you need to be aware of every single thing that&rsquo;s happening on the program all the time to make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss somebody else&rsquo;s Requirement that you must Question, and so everybody publishes a 1000 word update email every day and you read all them. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Every engineer was Responsible for their own part. But every engineer had perverse incentives. With all that Accelerating and Automating, if my parts got on the rocket on time, I succeeded. In fact, if the rocket never flew, I succeeded more, because my parts never got tested.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And so we made mistakes, and we did silly things. The rocket exploded a lot, and sometimes we learned something useful, but sometimes we didn&rsquo;t. We spent billions of dollars. And throughout it all, the program schedule slid inexorably to the right.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And I got cynical.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Once, long ago, the aerospace industry faced this exact sort of problem. In the early days of the Cold War, as the USA and USSR poured superpower resources into the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the initial result was a continuous stream of failures. The first version of the Atlas missile struggled so much in early flights that technicians called it the &ldquo;Inter-County Ballistic Missile.&rdquo; More importantly, the failures were not leading in the right direction - despite years of work and near-infinite money, reliability wasn&rsquo;t rising fast enough for these missiles to be placed on the firing line.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Many things helped ride to the rescue, but one of the most important was a new field called Systems Engineering.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The first recorded use of the term &ldquo;Systems Engineering&rdquo; came from a 1950 presentation by Mervin J. Kelly, Vice President of Bell Telephone. It appeared as a new business segment, coequal with mainstays like Research and Development. Like much of the writing on systems engineering, the anodyne tone hid huge ambition.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c9">&nbsp;&lsquo;Systems engineering&rsquo; controls and guides the use of the new knowledge obtained from the research and fundamental development programs &hellip; and the improvement and lowering of cost of services&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">In other words, this was meta-engineering.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">The problems were too complex, so the </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">process</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;had to be a designed thing, a product of its own, which would intake the project goals and output good decision making.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">It began with small things. There should be clear requirements for what the system is supposed to do. They should be boxed out and boiled down so that each engineer knows exactly what problem to solve and how it impacts the other ones. Changes would flow through the process and their impacts would be automatically assessed. Surrounding it grew a structure of reviews, process milestones, and organizational culture, to capture mistakes, record them, and make sure nobody else made them again.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And it worked! All of those transcendental results from Apollo were in fact supported on the foundations of exquisitely handled systems engineering and program management. The tools developed here helped catapult commercial aviation and sent probes off beyond the Solar System and much more besides.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">At SpaceX, there was no such thing as a &ldquo;Systems Engineer.&rdquo; The whole idea was anathema. After all, you could describe the point of systems engineering, and process culture more generally, as the process of </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">removing</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;human responsibility and agency. The point of building a system to control human behavior is that humans are fallible. You write them an endless list of rules to follow and procedures to read, and they follow them correctly, and then it works out.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">At SpaceX, it wasn&rsquo;t going to be like that. First principles thinking and Requirements Questioning and the centrality of responsible engineering all centered around the idea of raising the agency of each individual engineer. Raising individual responsibility was always better.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But even at SpaceX, even before the Algorithm, it wasn&rsquo;t always better.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Because of course, that was only for the engineers. Technicians on the program were encouraged to raise issues they noticed, or make suggestions, but, like production technicians everywhere, they were informed to follow written work instructions to the letter in everything they did. The work instructions, as one guide memorably put it, ought to be written assuming that the person carrying them out was &ldquo;hung over, mid-divorce, and being audited&rdquo; - in other words, not to be trusted.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s the difference? Well, for one thing, for a big production program you need a lot of technicians. It&rsquo;s possible to train every single one of them to be perfect all the time, but that&rsquo;s contingent on individual forces of culture and personality, so it&rsquo;s a lot easier to give them aggressively detailed instructions and expect them to be carried out.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">For another thing, for the most part technicians are in the unenviable position of being able to make things worse but not much better. If you do your job right, the part is built correctly; if you do not, it&rsquo;s probably worse.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But of course, there&rsquo;s nothing that limits those circumstances to technicians. The larger your organization is, and the more complex the task it has set its mind to, the more difficult it will be for you to train people to execute every element of it flawlessly.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And there are distressingly many contexts - for instance, when making anything with a human safety element - where the cost of failure is so much higher than the marginal gain from improvement that doing your job right means having it be baseline good. If you&rsquo;re doing it differently, you&rsquo;re probably making things worse.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Now, SpaceX was different, at first. There were enormous opportunities to have upside improvement in the rocket industry of the 2000s and 2010s. The company was small and scrappy and working hard. The rules applied.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But by the 2020s, even SpaceX was growing large. The company had passed 10,000 people, with programs across the country, tendrils in every major space effort and endlessly escalating ambition. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">And the larger it became, the greater the costs to its architecture became. As my program grew from dozens of people to hundreds to thousands, every RE needed to read more emails, track more issues, debate more requirements. And beyond that, every RE needed to be controlled by common culture to ensure good execution</span><span class="c17 c26 c14">, </span><span class="c2">which wasn&rsquo;t growing fast enough to meet the churn rate of the new engineers. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">Enter The Algorithm. It was a philosophy, and it was ritual, and it was </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">a set of rules to do Good Engineering. </span><span class="c2">If you followed it, you would succeed. If you didn&rsquo;t follow it, your manager would see that you didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The Algorithm imposed costs, the same way that any attempt to get people to follow a ruleset does. That was the whole point of the responsibility culture in the first place. And it was a pretty lightweight set of rules, vague enough to be complied with across a range of positions. Unless you squinted, you couldn&rsquo;t tell that anything had changed.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But something had.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Although they sounded like they fit perfectly with the engineering philosophy of the company, in reality they were a sort of surrender.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">If you were inclined to grand metaphor, you&rsquo;d be likely to write a review on ACX. So here goes, let&rsquo;s try one on.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Consider the &ldquo;systems engineering approach&rdquo; as analogous to a centrally planned economy. You decide what the requirements are at the beginning and they cascade inevitably downwards. From there, you build your Gantt charts and your Work Breakdown Structures and turn the crank. Out pops who should be doing what and when, just as if you were a Soviet bureaucrat, filling out the population tables to decide how many shoes to make this year.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Like centrally planned systems of days past, it puts forwards the vision of a perfect result - a model that incorporates every issue and outputs the Right Answer, even if the people implementing it are flawed humans. Also like centrally planned systems, it is brittle to new information and can choke itself in process.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">One might consider the &ldquo;Responsible Engineering&rdquo; system, then, to be a market system. Nobody can keep in their head the interlocking relationships that define the rocket engineering problem. Instead, every person in the machine is given incentives to get their part right and set to battle. Nobody in the system really has insight into the whole process, but the optimum design emerges via competition.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">Except that it&rsquo;s not a great metaphor. First, the problem with a competitive model of engineering is that, unlike in an economy, </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">everyone needs to succeed</span><span class="c17 c26">. The economy is fine with bad companies dying, but the rocket doesn&rsquo;t work if any part dies. So everybody needs to be </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">really good</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;at doing market economics and very in balance with one another. You can help that with aggressive and continuous purging of faltering employees - if you have an endless line of excellence out the door. But even so, continuous excellence requires a small enough scale to control culture very tightly.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">Second, it still runs into a complexity ceiling. The whole rocket has to work, which means that people </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">can&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2">just optimize for their local success - they all need, to some extent, to keep the entirety of the system in mind. And all the market actors are individuals - that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re avoiding the bureaucracy - which means that they run into an abstraction scale limit.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But most of all, the metaphor is bad because command economics has a reputation of having failed, but centralized engineering hasn&rsquo;t. In a sense, that&rsquo;s what capitalism is, a whole bunch of legal dictatorships called &ldquo;corporations&rdquo;, the majority of which operate on an largely centralized model.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The weaknesses of the centralized approach are circumstances that don&rsquo;t fit the rules - ones where there are new capabilities to be built, continuous improvement to be achieved, and room for some churn along the way. Over fifty years since Apollo, the aerospace industry, that great metaphor, had drifted in this direction, and the old culture had made it hard to change.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But there are other kinds of projects. If you&rsquo;re building a bridge, you might not be reinventing the truss, but your success is determined by exquisite execution on a thousand little problems the first time - by a process system. We design factories as systems that build a thousand cars a day, perfect every time. We make logistics networks that fill our stores with fresh food, just in time. We have building codes and airplane rules and food safety standards because they work.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The SpaceX responsibility approach is a good one, but it&rsquo;s not for everything. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Okay, so the answer is easy here. Various different approaches towards engineering can &nbsp;coexist, all doing their part, sometimes in the same company. The world is complicated, false dichotomy, etc, etc, you&rsquo;ve read this essay before.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But there&rsquo;s a story here, a powerful one, the same one that drove me when I started, that makes it hard to look at things like that.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">For one thing, the Responsible Engineering approach is so much more </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">fun</span><span class="c2">. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, but the RE one works best when exploring a new concept with a small, focused team of unusually talented people, and wow, just writing that sentence locks me back into wondering how I could ever do anything else. Of course everybody wants to say that that&rsquo;s how they think, of course every founder pitches their company like that. It&rsquo;s narrative, even when it&rsquo;s wrong.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And beyond that, it&rsquo;s all about SpaceX.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">SpaceX is a company that&rsquo;s so weird that in a worldbuilding project I would have considered it unrealistic.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">It&rsquo;s the space industry&rsquo;s Mary Sue, dominant, impossibly competent. Today, they launch multiple times a week while others launch a few times a year; they operate more satellites than the rest of humanity put together; they landed a rocket a decade ago and nobody has matched them since. Arguably, huge portions of the modern NASA policy of awarding single fixed-price contracts are a success </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">only </span><span class="c2">because of SpaceX - consider the commercial crew contract, on which SpaceX has been flawlessly delivering since 2020 but Boeing still can&rsquo;t manage. In the industry, every discussion goes back to them, desperately trying to divine the secrets of their success, or figure out how to compete, or complain that they cannot be beaten.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Most of all, SpaceX is seen as having fixed the space industry. It did what AMROC and Orbital and Beal didn&rsquo;t - shake up the incumbents, solve the problems, and bring about the glorious future of landing rockets.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And in the process, they&rsquo;ve thrown down a gauntlet. If they can revolutionize the space industry so crushingly, then people should be able to revolutionize other industries just as much. Just as the Apollo landings told people a story about what government could accomplish (&ldquo;if we can land a man on the moon, why can&rsquo;t we &hellip;&rdquo;), SpaceX tells a story (&ldquo;if we can land a rocket on a boat, why can&rsquo;t we &hellip;&rdquo;) that&rsquo;s about private enterprise, or first principles thinking, or whatever else the storyteller wants. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">So today, as SpaceX churns onwards through workforce, an ever-growing percentage of the economy is filled with firms with founders whose LinkedIn profiles say &ldquo;Former SpaceX&rdquo; in their headline. So much of this is hopeful and delightful, as people ride back into industries like nuclear that had long been abandoned by excitement. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to take another look at old books from the sixties and ask: can we do this better? Are the rules we set wrong?</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And in the process, a million eyes stare at SpaceX and wonder how they can capture the magic. Small changes in how SpaceX executes matter, for the industry and the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">This essay started off with a story of great disappointment, the climax of the Apollo program and the painful denouncement decades of slow progress that came out of it. Apollo created impossible hope and inspired millions to try and make their engineering dreams a reality. But its methods had limits that became painfully apparent over time, and the consequences of over-committing to those methods reverberate until SpaceX overthrew them.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">Today, SpaceX is dominant. Some of that dominance is their supernatural competence. But of course they are no longer a scrappy startup; now they also have infinite access to capital, infinite talent, infinite production scale, technology moats in every direction. Despite the fact that their rockets are now much cheaper than any similar past rocket, despite the fact that instead of falling in the ocean they land on boats and fly again, launch customers like </span><span class="c19 c17 c26"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/reusable-rockets-are-here-so-why-is-nasa-paying-more-to-launch-stuff-to-space/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170673077&amp;usg=AOvVaw3JfrfTX63C68GJfYRBPykh">NASA have to pay more than they paid Lockheed and Boeing in the 90s.</a></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Out of SpaceX came a rush of companies, all riding on the promise that this time it would be different. Many have failed catastrophically in the subsequent years. Some have not. Maybe a hardscrabble industry is dragging itself into existence in the giant&rsquo;s wake.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Within SpaceX, there are the barest hints of limits. Limits to scale, limits to the approach. They&rsquo;re getting embarrassed by test failures. The rules are creeping back. Now there&rsquo;s an Algorithm, to make sure people are doing it right.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">And beyond SpaceX, we all desperately try to grab what they&rsquo;re doing, picking things that are legible enough to copy, to slam into submission all the frustrations in our world.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">There are so many places where systems have failed us. It feels obvious that if only we could get the best people, cut the rules out, and let them work, it could fix everything.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">But SpaceX is now old and successful enough that it&rsquo;s not clear which things made it successful.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I contend that The Algorithm is not one of them.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I do not mean that it doesn&rsquo;t work, or that it&rsquo;s the wrong tool. (I also think it&rsquo;s probably gently more applicable to a field like car production than one like rockets for reasons that don&rsquo;t really fit in this review). It might be the right tool, but it obscures rather than heightens what made SpaceX work. It&rsquo;s an attempt to make legible the illegible, to systematize the lack of system.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The dream of individual responsibility as a solution to engineering problems is one that is heroic, capable, antifragile.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">We love that idea, we think it&rsquo;s cool and exciting. We want it to be everywhere. But by nature it is hard to copy, hard to systematize, and hard to rely upon.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17 c26">The dream of system responsibility as a solution to engineering problems is one that is legible, stable, </span><span class="c17 c26 c14">solved</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s easy to copy and scale, but a bit disappointing, and has a hard time being responsive.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">The pendulum swings back and forth between responsibility lying in the individual and the system. Both of them have limits grounded in our humanity. Maybe even the combination of the two has a limit, and humanity as it stands has a weak upper bound of possible complexity, of problems we can take on.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;d like to believe that we&rsquo;re doing more than swinging back and forth, that we&rsquo;re growing every time, reaching a more perfect synthesis.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t want us to swing in any particular direction because that&rsquo;s the narratively satisfying thing to do.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t work at SpaceX anymore. I don&rsquo;t know if the Algorithm phase has ended or if there&rsquo;s something new.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I admire the problem it&rsquo;s trying to solve - to take the approach of individual responsibility and pin it to a pinboard, preserve it, make it automatic, make it easy, make it understood, make it come off the assembly line and scale to the stars. I love thinking that way, I hope that it&rsquo;s possible.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">I do keep watching SpaceX&rsquo;s future, because it&rsquo;s now the vanguard for a model that is having its moment to go everywhere. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">Time will tell how far it can go. </span></p><p class="c23 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">[1] Annoyingly, people sometimes say that SpaceX was the first private company to reach orbit, when in fact Orbital Sciences was fairly regularly launching - from a plane - years beforehand, and Space Sciences, Incorporated had reached space privately years before that.

In recent years, I turned fairly strongly against it. Now, having moderated somewhat, and after many long discussions and arguments with a female cousin, I&rsquo;ve attempted to &ldquo;steelman&rdquo; both sides of a few key debates. This dialogue is an experiment, to see what happens when 2011-me and 2021-me go head-to-head within my own brain. In general, </span><span class="c8">Angelica </span><span>represents a mixture of my own positions a decade ago and the positions of my cousin. </span><span class="c8">Alexius</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;represents a mixture of my positions a few years ago and those of a few online critiques of feminism that I&rsquo;ve found compelling (even if I didn&rsquo;t end up agreeing with them). Beyond that, I&rsquo;ve occasionally tried to steelman positions that neither I nor someone I trust ever believed, but I&rsquo;ve mostly avoided doing this. So when Alexius and Angelica agree on something, it means the rejection of that thing is a position I&rsquo;ve never understood, nor has my cousin, nor has a case for it been persuasively made to me. Since this happens reasonably often, the dialogue may be of limited interest to those who do hold to such a rejection.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Beyond that, my focus has been to present opposing attitudes faithfully, rather than definitely resolve issues. And by &ldquo;feminism&rdquo;, I simply mean the general cluster of attitudes found in 2010s-era users of the term, with no more precision than that.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.mtla6ut7r1mb"><span class="c25 c39">General</span></h2><p class="c10 c70"><span>ALEXIUS:</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">&nbsp;Hi.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ANGELICA</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">: Um, hi. Well, I&#39;m a feminist.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ALEXIUS: </span><span class="c40 c53 c66">And I think feminism is destructive and toxic, and does nothing but hurt and oppress men. Let&#39;s begin the debate.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ANGELICA</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">: All right, let&#39;s. I&#39;m a feminist because I believe women are consistently mistreated, brutalised, and oppressed. I believe strident feminism is just and necessary in the world we&#39;re living in.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ALEXIUS:</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ANGELICA</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">: Honestly, where do I start? Okay, first is the unfair double standards, there are so many of them, and they&#39;re just so unfair. Men having sex is admirable, women having it is shameful. Men speaking up assertively is encouraged, women doing it is condemned. Fathers can have careers but mothers should devote their lives to their children. Boys will be boys but girls need to act proper and all that. How can anyone defend this kind of thing? It&#39;s the definition of unfairness. It&#39;s repugnant to reason itself. And who can deny these attitudes are extremely widespread if you interact with people a tiny bit? Have a consistent principle one way or the other! But people won&#39;t do that. We need feminism to make them do the basically fair thing.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">Second, the amount of violence inflicted on women is just astronomical. Just look at the news every day. The amount of domestic violence, of sexual violence, of sex trafficking, of media exploitation, and of routine dehumanisation of women by men. Just look at locker room talk, look at unmoderated internet comments sections, look at how juries aquit rapists because &quot;she was asking for it&quot;, look at how women are harassed and hated in so many fields and subcultures. Nothing remotely like this, at this scale, happens to men. How can you possibly deny that? In a remotely civilised, just world, women, being usually physically weaker would be given MORE protection by society, rather than LESS. How is it not the most evil thing you can imagine, a world where untold millions of women are beaten regularly, or raped regularly, or stuck in abusive relationships terrified they&#39;ll be killed if they leave, or their children will? How is it not the most evil world, where huge sections of society, police, workplaces, street culture, are committed not to protecting them but to all these prejudices excusing their abuse? &nbsp;How can you possibly say we don&#39;t need a really militant strong movement to stop all this evil happening? And how can you POSSIBLY say men are &quot;oppressed&quot; in any meaningful way by comparison?</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">And third, all the prejudices about what women can&#39;t do, and the gender roles they&#39;re forced into, and the discrimination accompanying that. Do you have any idea how hurtful it is to not be encouraged in your talents, but discouraged and pressured into giving up your dreams because all you&#39;re fit for is getting married and having children? To see your male classmates and coworkers get every assistance and encouragement that you&#39;re denied? To see that nearly every &quot;hero&quot; of history, and nearly every famous fictional character, is a man?. To never be judged as an individual but always as &quot;the girl&quot;? I don&#39;t think you have any idea at all what this is like! Do you honestly believe this happens just as much to men? I mean, apart from maybe a handful of very feminine fields and being a stay-at-home parent. That&#39;s it. In the vast, vast majority of careers and hobbies and areas of life, men are assumed to be fit and capable, women are not. How can you possibly say both sexes are oppressed equally, or that we don&#39;t need feminism?</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span>ALEXIUS: </span><span class="c40 c53 c66">Hmm, okay. I see your points somewhat, and I see how my original statement was misleading. I suppose I don&#39;t think feminism &quot;oppresses men&quot; in the collective sense you&#39;re talking about. What I would instead say is the following four points.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">First, strident feminists are, in general, the worst people in the world! I&#39;m not even exaggerating. They seem to lack every single virtue and possess every single vice magnified to the extreme. They are utterly consumed with rage and hate. They are vulgar and hedonistic, seeming to lack any concept of beauty or compassion. They are the most proudly selfish people I&#39;ve seen, saying &quot;I want&quot; and &quot;I demand&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck about your feelings&quot; an unimaginable amount. They are childish and juvenile, completely unempathic, sadistic and love scapegoating people and hurting them as much as they can (men who are extremely feminist but slightly disagree on one thing being their favourite targets), they are stupid and mathematically illiterate and PROUD of that, and I could go on and on. Even if your theoretical feminism were impeccable, I&#39;d refuse to endorse the label until I can look at the average prominent self-described feminist and see someone with something resembling a conscience.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">Second, women just aren&#39;t meaningfully oppressed in most of the West. Maybe they used to be (though I think the conscription issue might have counteracted all of that) but definitely not now. The wage gap is a myth: if you examine the data and adjust for the CHOICES women make (to work less hours for example) it disappears. Domestic violence is taken very seriously, so seriously that ordinary due process rights are uniquely stripped away in that particular context. &nbsp;I could agree that feminism was necessary 50 years ago or 100 years ago but it definitely isn&#39;t today, where WE are.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">Third, this leads on to the fact that in all the places where what you describe is indeed the reality, where horrific violence and misogyny is the norm, the feminist left not only doesn&#39;t care about stopping it, they ACTIVELY STAND IN THE WAY of doing anything about it! The Islamic world, for example, is full to the brim of just the evil you describe. I&#39;d guess one small set of average Muslims contains more violent misogyny than all the West put together! And yet the feminists do everything they can to STOP us fighting that, and to call it racist to even mention it, and to totally shut down discussion of every aspect of the issue! What...the...fuck! Seriously, what the fuck? And it&#39;s the same with black rap culture misogyny, and East Asian misogyny, and misogyny in various indigenous groups. How can you possibly deny that this is all a billion times worse than what happens in white Western culture? How can you possibly deny that woke feminists do everything they can to shut down discussions of that? And how, therefore, can you deny that feminists don&#39;t actually give a fuck about vulnerable women suffering, and care only about privileged rich white Western women and their comparatively trivial problems?</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">Fourth, about oppressing men. What I mean is not that men as a whole are oppressed by feminism, I agree that&#39;s ridiculous. What I mean is that vulnerable men, unpopular men, low-status men, are oppressed by feminism. That feminism and feminist policies provide a tool for doing horrible injustices to these types of men, a horribly successful tool that&#39;s almost impossible to resist or even talk negatively about! It&#39;s a reliable weapon that women, whenever they have a problem with a man of lower status or lesser individual power than themselves, can use to get their way, to demonize their rival no matter the merits, and to shut down any challenge to what they&rsquo;re doing by deeming it sexist or patriarchal.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">ANGELICA: All right. On your third point, I have nothing to disagree with. I totally agree that misogyny is a billion times worse in the Islamic world. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t fight the misogyny we have in the West as well, but it absolutely does mean we should be focusing heaps of attention and scrutiny and condemnation on the Islamic world and doing everything we can to end their evil practices and their brutal treatment of women. I don&rsquo;t think the feminists who ignore that fact are at all as numerous as you imply, but I agree they exist and I can&rsquo;t possibly defend them.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">I completely disagree with your second point. Just because some problems are taken more seriously than in the past, doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t still exist to a huge extent. Domestic violence happens all the time. Most of it goes unpunished. Whatever the reason for a wage gap, there is one. And that creates inequality.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c66">As for feminists being aggressive and cruel, I agree they can be. It&rsquo;s not ideal, obviously, and I wish they were more rational and compassionate, on the whole. But the key thing you&rsquo;re ignoring is that when there&rsquo;s this huge powerful system of harmful and oppressive practices that has existed for so long, anyone wanting to fight it is going to have to use a lot of aggression and anger. That&rsquo;s just what a fight is. Also, it&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to take </span><span class="c66 c14">too</span><span class="c66">&nbsp;much concern from a few men being occasionally mistreated by feminists. I agree it&rsquo;s wrong. </span><span class="c66 c14">But</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">, given how much women have suffered at the hands of men, and for how long that has been the case, it really seems like a kind of justice for there to be a bit of a reversal.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c66">ALEXIUS: Justice? That&rsquo;s like saying because Jews oppressed Christians in 1</span><span class="c74 c66">st</span><span class="c66">&nbsp;century Judea, it&rsquo;s justice for Christians to oppress Jews in 15</span><span class="c74 c66">th</span><span class="c66">&nbsp;century Spain. The people who did the atrocities and the people suffering are </span><span class="c66 c14">different people</span><span class="c40 c53 c66">.</span></p><p class="c10 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66">ANGELICA: Well, I didn&rsquo;t say it was literal justice, did I?</span></p><p class="c10 c21 c70"><span class="c40 c53 c66"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.8k73nhr5zjpp"><span class="c25 c39">Sexual harassment</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: So what about sexual harassment? In, like, the vast majority of fields, women are harassed. Not all women, sure, not all the time for the ones who are. But a lot of us are harassed, and for some it really is all the time. How can you defend this?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Who says I defend it?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Well how can you say a strong response isn&rsquo;t necessary? Are women supposed to just accept this risk, every time they start a new job, every time some new people start working with them, as just the price of existing? Are the ones </span><span class="c14">being </span><span class="c3">harassed just supposed to take the daily fear, and daily humiliation?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Can you define harassment?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Behaviour that makes someone feel terrible? I think you know what I mean by harassment, and I hope you&rsquo;re not trying to rules-lawyer me or play semantics.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: No, I swear I&rsquo;m acting in good faith here. I think the definition is crucial. Why don&rsquo;t I give mine and you tell me what you think? I&rsquo;d say harassment, sexual or otherwise, is a kind of bullying that </span><span class="c14">requires the intent to make someone upset</span><span>. As long as it&rsquo;s defined like </span><span class="c14">that</span><span class="c3">, I will whole-heartedly condemn it and call for its eradication from all schools and workplaces.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: So you&rsquo;re saying it has to require intent?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Yes and that most of the feminists explicitly reject this requirement.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Well it all depends what you mean by good intent. If you honestly didn&rsquo;t know something might ever be a problem, and as soon it&rsquo;s pointed out you stop? Or, if you knew it would upset her, but your &ldquo;official intention&rdquo; was just to make a joke or arouse yourself, so you did it anyway? Those two are very, </span><span class="c14">very</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;different.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: I&rsquo;d include all cases of the first, and some of the second, under good intent. &ldquo;Making a joke&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t cut it, because that almost always means laughing at someone, which by its nature is a nasty intention. But genuinely wanting to go on a date with someone, knowing she might be angry at being asked out but giving it a try, and she gets angry&hellip;I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s her problem, if she takes &nbsp;a good faith expression of natural human affection as somehow offensive.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: The thing is, she might have some kind of trauma. It might actually be really stressful for her to be asked out, even if it&rsquo;s done politely.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: So therefore what?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: So therefore it&rsquo;s important to be very sure something like that is wanted, or not unwanted, when you&rsquo;re in an enclosed environment that the woman can&rsquo;t easily leave. Like a workplace.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: It doesn&rsquo;t seem reasonable to me that something so desired by the vast majority of the population, romantic love, should be denied to them in many contexts because there are a few people with hang-ups and traumas. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be the responsibility of the latter to clearly telegraph that they don&rsquo;t want that? Instead of expecting others to read their minds? Or only ever asking people out who have already made clear they want to be asked out?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: The harm done by having something done to you is far greater than the harm of not getting something you want.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: But the number of people who consider that a &ldquo;harm&rdquo; is much, much smaller I would think. So the consequentialism evens out. Plus, there are suicidally lonely people. Does that latter fact upend your moral calculation?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: No because that&rsquo;s even rarer. </span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.btxiie9in9pw"><span class="c25 c39">Abortion</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Abortion? Are you against it?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Against it? Uh, yes I am. With a few narrow and compelling exceptions. Killing another human being, let alone a baby, for your own convenience is&hellip;I honestly can&rsquo;t find the words.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Okay, do you think it&rsquo;s wrong to eat chicken?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: I don&rsquo;t think so, no. Are you trying to make a moral equivalence between a baby and a chicken?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Well, hear me out. You&rsquo;re calling it a baby, which I&rsquo;ll accept for the sake of the discussion to avoid stupid semantic games. It seems to me there are three ways you can argue that a chicken and a human baby are morally different. First, you could say that God created humans, but not chickens, in his image, and commanded us not to kill humans only in whatever holy book. But that&rsquo;s entirely unpersuasive to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t share those religious beliefs, and a secular state surely shouldn&rsquo;t have laws that make sense only from a particular religious perspective.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: That definitely isn&rsquo;t the basis of my objection.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Second, you could say that because </span><span class="c14">we</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are humans, we have special obligations to fellow human beings, which we don&rsquo;t have to other species. But how is this any meaningfully different than saying that because we are white, we have special obligations to other white people that we don&rsquo;t have to other races?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Hm.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: The argument has literally the exact same form!</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: All right, I&rsquo;ll accept it, but it seems like a weird analogy. I can&rsquo;t prove why though.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: So that leaves a third reason, which is I think clearly the only defensible one. Human beings have vastly greater intelligence, memories, emotions, desires for the future, and so on. That justifies treating an ordinary human and a chicken completely differently. But a baby in the womb, even at a late stage, possesses </span><span class="c14">none</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of these properties that distinguish us from chickens. It probably possesses far less of these than a chicken! I adapted this argument from Peter Singer, and I think it shows that there is no morally defensible basis for being pro-life but eating meat.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Is that the entirety of your reason for being pro-choice?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: I mean that that&rsquo;s an argument strictly from a lack of sentience in an unborn baby. I disagree with the argument, and I&rsquo;ll explain why in a moment. But I want to say that I can respect the argument (and that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s evil, only misguided) in a way that I can&rsquo;t respect the standard feminist defences of abortion. Which are usually pretty explicitly clear that they don&rsquo;t consider it </span><span class="c14">relevant </span><span>whether or not an unborn child is sentient, and that a woman has an </span><span class="c14">unconditional right</span><span>&nbsp;to kill her baby </span><span class="c14">even if it&rsquo;s fully or partially sentient</span><span>, even if it&rsquo;s in horrible pain, for </span><span class="c14">any reason at all</span><span class="c3">, or none! And I find that&hellip;quite possibly the most evil sentiment I&rsquo;ve ever heard a person express to my face.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Well, there is the Violinist Argument that&rsquo;s often used as an additional defence of abortion. Is that what you&rsquo;re referring to?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of thing I&rsquo;m referring to. I think that argument is horribly flawed in numerous ways, not least of which that it only works (and was only originally intended) for abortion in cases of rape. But more fundamentally than that, I just can&rsquo;t comprehend how any decent person could be emotionally capable of accepting that conclusion. To look at an innocent, infinitely vulnerable person connected to them and coldly think </span><span class="c14">only of themselves. </span><span>Just, </span><span class="c33 c44 c14">who could think like that?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Hm, okay, I think there are some things you&rsquo;re skirting over here. First, I see the Violinist Argument as not a central part of my reason for being pro-choice, but as an additional useful point, and I see the point primarily as the fact that most men </span><span class="c14">would not accept the moral obligation to stay connected to an innocent person themselves</span><span>. I think it&rsquo;s telling how few pro-life men actually bite the bullet and say you should stay connected to the violinist. &nbsp;If they did </span><span class="c14">that</span><span>, instead of weaselling around trying to say the cases are totally different, then I would feel very differently. It&rsquo;s all about the hypocrisy for me. Now I want to make clear that I don&rsquo;t think the pro-life movement is built on hatred of women--that&rsquo;s a stupid claim. (I think it </span><span class="c14">is</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;mostly built on religion: you can hardly find a pro-life organisation that can resist mentioning God or the Bible on a regular basis, or that they&rsquo;re also against homosexuality or something else that has nothing whatsoever to do with saving babies, and this is the main thing that makes it difficult for me to take their moral claims seriously.) But I do think it&rsquo;s grounded in certain male-centric perspectives. I do think pro-life thinking, whether currently expressed by men or women, was formulated by men as abstract moral reasoning that, for the men formulating it, was understood implicitly as something that would never apply to them. It&rsquo;s very easy to abstractly argue that some consideration has no moral relevance when you&rsquo;ll never be affected by it. I see the Violinist Argument as exposing that deficit, showing how many who dismiss bodily autonomy when it&rsquo;s relevant only to women suddenly give it much more weight when they can imagine a scenario where it would apply to them. I think this greatly strengthens the pro-choice position, but the foundation of that position is still very much the lack of foetal sentience.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: Look, I disagree with the sentience argument for three reasons. First, we don&rsquo;t possess perfect medical and scientific knowledge. No matter what modern medicine says about the existence of consciousness at a specific stage of development, it&rsquo;s always possible that future research could show we were wrong about that, even if currently can&rsquo;t see how. This has happened innumerable times throughout history. So running the (perhaps small, perhaps not; we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know!) risk of murdering millions of partially conscious human beings for reasons of convenience (or any other less-than-compelling reasons) is unconscionable. &nbsp;Second, even </span><span class="c14">if </span><span>unborn babies at that point aren&rsquo;t at all sentient, institutionalizing the principle that it&rsquo;s okay to kill humans if they lack certain abilities or faculties is so incredibly dangerous, for what I hope are obvious reasons. How much easier will it be to further extend this lack of legal protection to other humans, on other grounds than lack of consciousness, as long as we have this precedent of making such broad exceptions? And third, to move away from these strictly consequentialist arguments, I see it as fundamentally evil, in a virtue-ethical sense, to kill a fellow human being (let alone your own child!) for minor or selfish reasons. A lack of consciousness does not stop this being an intrinsically vicious act. And if you do so openly </span><span class="c14">not caring </span><span>whether the child is conscious or not, calling that a completely irrelevant consideration&mdash;very explicitly the position of most feminists, regardless of what your own position is&mdash;that makes the viciousness </span><span class="c14">infinitely </span><span class="c3">worse!</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: I think we have to go with what science actually says, not what it might say in some hypothetical universe. There&rsquo;s an obvious unbridgeable difference between a lack of consciousness&mdash;the possession of which is </span><span class="c14">what it means to be a being</span><span>&mdash;and a lack of any other property. And this &ldquo;benefit of the doubt&rdquo; argument is not one we apply in pretty much </span><span class="c14">any other context</span><span class="c3">. We don&rsquo;t ban cars and electricity on the basis that running the risk of killing human beings is never justified for reasons of &ldquo;convenience&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: I think there is an </span><span class="c14">unbridgeable</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;moral difference &ldquo;doing an action that has a small risk of killing a sentient human being&rdquo; and &ldquo;deliberately killing a human being who has a small chance of being sentient&rdquo;. Only the most na&iuml;ve utilitarianism&mdash;the kind that says failing to save lives in Africa is exactly moral equivalent to murdering people&mdash;could suggest those things are in the same moral universe.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Of course, you&rsquo;re also greatly downplaying the actual effect on women of having to carry a baby. This is never in the remote ballpark of &ldquo;mere convenience&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s telling that you would describe it so.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: It is close to mere convenience </span><span class="c14">on the scale from nothing to death</span><span>. That&rsquo;s what my objection is: not to saying that there are significant moral interests in women avoiding unwanted pregnancies, but to saying that these </span><span class="c14">totally outweigh </span><span>the moral interests of babies in continuing to live! To the extent that the latter is of </span><span class="c14">no significance at all</span><span class="c3">!</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Look, even if there are a lot of feminists who talk like that, and ignore the sentience issue, how does that change the fact that the sentience issue </span><span class="c14">does exist</span><span class="c3">? You&rsquo;re basically saying that because a position has some bad arguments made for it, that we should reject it even if good arguments can be made for it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: Well I do have some issues with the &ldquo;good arguments&rdquo; as well. But I agree the sentience ones are somewhat principled and morally coherent, and not evil. But I disagree that the existence of the evil arguments doesn&rsquo;t matter. This isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;some people&rdquo; making these arguments; this is the </span><span class="c14">entire movement</span><span>&nbsp;dedicated to maintaining legal abortion being grounded in the assertion that an </span><span class="c14">entire class of human beings</span><span>, based solely on </span><span class="c14">where they are</span><span>, have </span><span class="c14">no rights whatsoever</span><span>. That is what &ldquo;bodily autonomy&rdquo; means in this context! There&rsquo;s a hardly a feminist on the planet who doesn&rsquo;t endorse &ldquo;bodily autonomy&rdquo; in the context of abortion, and that phrase </span><span class="c14">by logical definition </span><span class="c3">implies that an entire class of humans have no rights whatsoever! I think such an ideology is so fundamentally repugnant to any moral or civilized society that it needs to be maximally opposed, by all decent people, at all costs.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: It&rsquo;s easy to make that characterization. The reason it&rsquo;s easy is that, for most of human history, women&rsquo;s interest were not taken into account by law and morality at all. And so, you can look at the moral doctrines that were formulated over that time and see no distinction made between human beings, of questionable sentience, in the womb, and unquestionably sentient human beings outside the womb. And because no such distinction was reliably made in past moral thinking, you can look at modern feminists trying to institutionalize this enormous distinction and see a terrifying movement aimed at stripping away previously recognized rights. But the </span><span class="c14">only reason</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;this looks terrifying is because it&rsquo;s so new, and the only reason it&rsquo;s so new is because there was no motivation to make the distinction in the past, since women&rsquo;s interests had no weight.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The reality is that abortion is a unique kind of moral situation. The bodily autonomy of women in this case isn&rsquo;t at all comparable to bodily autonomy in other cases, I grant you that. But also, the right to life in this case isn&rsquo;t at all comparable to a right to life in almost all other cases. It&rsquo;s a unique situation that in an ideal world would have been heavily debated and analysed throughout history. In our imperfect world, where women were ignored until a century ago, it got hardly any debate, and so the current situation looks terrifying. But I maintain that once you put aside that apparent horror, which exists only because centuries of moral doctrine was formulated only be men, feminists are making a case for a coherent position that extends women the autonomy that men take for granted, with the tradeoff being removing a &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; from a group of beings that, we argue, it never made much sense to ascribe that right to had all sentient interests been properly taken into account.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: I feel like this reasoning can be used to justify nearly any radical human-threatening and rights-threatening movement. Maybe the only reason Jews are considered human is because of biased Jewish-controlled history. Maybe the only reason kings aren&rsquo;t allowed to rule their subjects like slaves is because the last few centuries have been maligned by an unfair disregard for the natural rights of kings. My position, and I&rsquo;m firm on this, is that a morally decent political movement is not going to ground itself in the elimination of the previously-acknowledged rights of a particular group. Humane people, with humane goals, will always have ways of reforming society </span><span class="c14">without</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;doing such a thing.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.lkydxcyvn6r"><span class="c25 c39">Nice guys</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Okay so the Nice Guy issue. What do you think of that?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: They&rsquo;re not really nice.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: How can you say that?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: We&rsquo;re talking about men who are &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to women and then get angry when they won&rsquo;t sleep with them! Being &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to someone only to </span><span class="c14">get something from </span><span class="c3">them is not being actually nice at all. And I don&rsquo;t think you have any idea how hurtful it is to find out that he was only nice to you to have sex with you. And to then be condemned for not &ldquo;rewarding&rdquo; this fake niceness!</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: Okay there are two problems with your characterisation. The first is that the average Nice Guy is </span><span class="c14">actually </span><span>nice, generally speaking. That&rsquo;s how I and many others use the term, not for someone simply feigning niceness. It still seems to be clearly the case that such men are generally unattractive to women. And that creates </span><span class="c14">enormous</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;problems for the entire project of feminism.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>The second is that even if we&rsquo;re talking about merely instrumentally nice men (which we&rsquo;re usually </span><span class="c14">not</span><span>), the complaint is </span><span class="c14">not</span><span>&nbsp;that these men deserve a date or whatever for simply acting nice. It&rsquo;s that they deserve more, or at least as much, as someone who approaches women and </span><span class="c14">doesn&rsquo;t even attempt to treat them nicely</span><span>. And yet the empirical evidence seems to show that they get treated </span><span class="c14">worse</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">I agree there are some men who complain that being nice doesn&rsquo;t get them a date, full stop. But the standard grievance is simply this: if I&rsquo;m nice to you and you reject me, that&rsquo;s fine, but don&rsquo;t then go and date the other guy who treats you like shit!</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: So wait a minute, first of all, why exactly does this create &ldquo;enormous problems&rdquo; for feminism?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Basically, feminism tells men to treat women respectfully. If you have a state of the world where men who do that are consistently less attractive to women than men who disregard respect, and less likely to get dates, then you are, first of all, causing the men who do the right thing to be disadvantaged for it, which is intrinsically unfair. But second and most importantly, you teach men that obeying feminists gets punished and ignoring them gets rewarded. I can&rsquo;t think of anything more destructive to the cause of feminism!</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Okay. Well, I could challenge you on the factual basis of this claim that genuinely nice, respectful men are less attractive to women. I could point out three things. First, that most of the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for this claim comes from personal anecdotes and the collections of these anecdotes and complaints that accumulate on very biased platforms (where men whose experiences don&rsquo;t fit the trope at all have no incentive to speak up, and every reason to think they&rsquo;ll be attacked for lying or &ldquo;whiteknighting&rdquo; or whatever), so they are nothing remotely like a fair sample. And trying to do surveys or polls with this sort of thing is almost impossible, because of the sheer number of confounding factors many of which (e.g. looks, charisma, previous social interactions with the same person) are all but impossible to accurately survey or control for. Second, anyone who has been rejected by a love interest in favour of another person has an extreme vested interest in viewing that other person as a horrible asshole, since they are a rival. I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s possible to overcome this overwhelming psychological bias, and that makes almost all these anecdotes compellingly flawed. Third, there </span><span class="c14">is</span><span>&nbsp;a type of &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; who women frequently find highly attractive, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s what you think it is. It&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c14">hero </span><span class="c3">who is moral and kind but also strong and brutal against bad people, i.e. a protector. I think most women would say the kindness is the most important part, but that given that, a strong kind man is more attractive than a weak or somewhat cowardly kind man. But many men think that means a strong abusive man is better than a weak kind man, which is completely wrong!</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Well, you make some insightful points, but I&rsquo;m not sure there isn&rsquo;t still a lot of evidence for my claim, even controlling for all that.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Maybe, maybe not. My point is really that you can&rsquo;t be sure, your confidence in the claim is unjustified. But resolving factual questions definitely is not really possible here. So let&rsquo;s move on to the theory.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: I agree, and in any case, I&rsquo;d be quite reasonably happy if you insisted that you don&rsquo;t believe this rejection of nice guys really happens, but that </span><span class="c14">if it did</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;it would be a very bad thing that needs to stop. That&rsquo;s what most of us want, for the grievance to be acknowledged and not shut down. If women did routinely prefer assholes to nice guys, do you acknowledge that they need to be in some sense shamed for that? They&rsquo;d be doing more damage to women&rsquo;s rights than almost anything men do, because they&rsquo;d be creating an overwhelming incentive for men to not respect women.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Well I already pointed out the view that many of these Nice Guys are actually feigning niceness to get you in bed. And even if they&rsquo;re not, even if they think they&rsquo;re genuinely nice, if they are expecting a reward for it and upset if they don&rsquo;t get it I&rsquo;d question how nice they </span><span class="c14">truly</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are. Actually nice people don&rsquo;t expect to be rewarded for basic decency! I see no reason why feminists should agree to shame women for resisting such sexist manipulation!</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: As I said above, there are many men who really are nice (to everyone, not just to the women they want to sleep with), and you&rsquo;re doing this unfair thing where you create a category that does exist (men feigning niceness for sex) and then exploit the similar wording shared between the fake and genuine case (&ldquo;Nice Guys&rdquo; with capitals) to trick people into lumping the latter into the former. It&rsquo;s a rhetorical trick.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>But I&rsquo;m particularly bothered by the second thing you said, that you&rsquo;re not really nice if you get upset that your niceness isn&rsquo;t acknowledged or reciprocated. This is so psychologically cruel it&rsquo;s hard to describe. Imagine a cult that demands perfect morality of its members, and you&rsquo;re a member and you try </span><span class="c14">so hard</span><span>&nbsp;to be perfect, but you&rsquo;re told you&rsquo;re probably going to hell anyway. And despite this you keep trying, and even when you see the cult leaders being hypocrites and violating all their own rules you keep your head down and keep trying to be good anyway, because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. Then one day you can&rsquo;t stand it any longer and you politely point out unfair it is that no matter what you do you&rsquo;re still dammed, and that the leaders don&rsquo;t even try and are somehow rewarded. And the leaders tell you that this </span><span class="c14">proves </span><span>you were never really moral to begin with, and that you were only doing it for a reward and so now you&rsquo;re </span><span class="c14">definitely</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;going to hell and you&rsquo;ve proven you deserve to. This is the kind of psychological abuse that your thinking amounts to here.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>It&rsquo;s eminently reasonable for a genuinely good person to be upset when their good behaviour is not acknowledged or reciprocated. It does not in any way prove that they weren&rsquo;t genuinely good. And again, what most of us are asking for here is absolutely </span><span class="c14">not</span><span>&nbsp;that being respectful to women should get us a date. It&rsquo;s that it should </span><span class="c14">help</span><span class="c3">, even if only slightly, and above all that it shouldn&rsquo;t in any circumstances harm us!</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: All right, I&rsquo;ll admit that saying &ldquo;women shouldn&rsquo;t date insufficiently nice men&rdquo; is a much better take than &ldquo;women </span><span class="c14">should</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;date me, because I&rsquo;m sufficiently nice&rdquo;. I think the first problem is that you greatly understate how much of the Nice Guy discourse really is the second one. And even if it currently isn&rsquo;t (which I think is clearly false) normalizing the first claim makes it far too easy to normalize the second one, and I hope you can see how harmful that would be. &ldquo;If I tick these boxes, you&rsquo;re obligated to date me&rdquo; is so contrary to everything feminism stands for that I hope it&rsquo;s understandable why feminists would fight tooth-and-nail against permitting any attitudes that have even a possibility of turning into that.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Beyond that, I think you mischaracterize feminists if you think they are in favour of women dating disrespectful or abusive men. Most feminists would say that&rsquo;s a terrible thing for a woman to do, and that she should be encouraged not to do such a self-harmful thing. Some would be against &ldquo;shaming&rdquo; her nonetheless, due to what a shaming culture can lead to (see my previous point) and some </span><span class="c14">would</span><span>&nbsp;shame her as normalizing such behaviour and harming women generally. The one thing they&rsquo;ll agree on though is that the harm of such a thing is towards </span><span class="c14">women</span><span>. The thing that makes the Nice Guy discourse so repugnant is that it presents </span><span class="c14">nice men</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as the ones being harmed. And it&rsquo;s hard to view this as anything other than men thinking they&rsquo;re entitled to be dated just because they&rsquo;re sufficiently nice.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: As I explained, it&rsquo;s not that. It&rsquo;s harmful to women, for obvious reasons, and harmful to men due to the </span><span class="c14">psychological harm</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of being disadvantaged for doing the right thing, and seeing those who do the wrong thing rewarded for it. You&rsquo;re greatly underplaying this psychological harm. I, at least, would be perfectly happy if the world changed so that not a single nice guy gets any more dates, but all the not-nice guys stop getting dates. That would be a perfect solution.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">And I don&rsquo;t perceive that feminists are remotely interested in making that happen. Why don&rsquo;t you want to make that happen?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: I think, ultimately, that this discourse has such potential harms, as I mentioned, and has become so toxic, that it needs to be avoided. These discussions, about women tolerating abusive treatment and how men are supposed to interpret and relate to that fact, can be held in different terms and with different vocabulary. Avoid the term &ldquo;Nice Guy&rdquo; and all its associated lore, and avoid centring men as the primary ones being harmed, and maybe these discussions would be more fruitful, and feminists would be less likely to think you&rsquo;re implying things you may not be.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: That sounds exactly equivalent to a demand that the word &ldquo;feminism&rdquo; should be retired, and that discussions of sexual equality should be held without any of the confrontational tones of modern feminism. I struggle to see any meaningful difference.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.17o1l19pawzv"><span class="c25 c39">Privilege </span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Do you think men are &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; over women?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Of course. I don&rsquo;t even know how you could deny it. Do I have to list average income, representation in legislatures and on company boards, traditional religious doctrines, social judgements on sexual behaviour, leads in movies, physical safety in public, and on and on and on?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Well what about custody and crime and, historically, conscription?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Those are a handful of examples in the pro-female direction. In the pro-male direction, we have thousands! That&rsquo;s what we mean by privilege.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: All right, let&rsquo;s talk about privilege. I find the feminist discourse on privilege so outrageous and obnoxious, because there&rsquo;s this fundamental incoherency in the definition of privilege that they use: they have two different definitions, and they switch between them whenever convenient, and whenever it allows them to be most indifferent to the suffering of people other than them.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>The </span><span class="c14">first</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;definition, which makes perfect sense on its own, is the following: A is privileged over B if A is, all things considered, better off overall than B. This is a fine definition of privilege, and one that captures what people usually mean by the term. But feminists aren&rsquo;t consistent with it at all. As soon as you point out that a homeless man is obviously less privileged than a rich and powerful woman, they insist that that doesn&rsquo;t count, that the former&rsquo;s male privilege is not in any way negated by his lack of some other kind of privilege. So they&rsquo;re denying that it&rsquo;s a matter of being better off overall.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Well, there&rsquo;s a second definition that allows that response, and it&rsquo;s also a reasonable definition on its own. Which is that A is privileged over B if A is, in </span><span class="c14">some </span><span>areas of life, advantaged over B. On </span><span class="c14">this</span><span>&nbsp;definition, you </span><span class="c14">can</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;insist that a homeless man has privilege over a rich woman, on the basis that there are certain areas in which he&rsquo;s still advantaged over her, despite the much larger number of areas in which it&rsquo;s the reverse. But feminists don&rsquo;t stick to this definition either, because it would imply that while men are privileged over women (due to things like domestic violence and representation in high positions), women are also privileged over men (due to things like child custody and criminal sentences). So, as far as I can tell, feminists have no consistent definition of privilege. They rely on the first definition when it suits them, switch to the second definition when it suits them, and in both cases to dismiss the grievances of anyone other than the affluent women who run their movement.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Well, look, as a preliminary point I want to note that it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to construct a coherent definition of privilege that excludes both of your cases.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Yeah, sure, you can construct a convoluted ad hoc definition&mdash;like, A is privileged over B if and only if A belongs to a different demographic group than B, and it&rsquo;s one of the demographic groups that has been deemed to matter and not one of the ones that hasn&rsquo;t, and that demographic group is overall better off, but only in the areas of life that have been deemed to matter, and when comparing demographic groups their precise unique circumstances need to be carefully considered and not rounded off to which one is better off overall, but when comparing individuals they need to be rounded off to the overall position of their group and their precise unique circumstances ignored&mdash;but that&rsquo;s pretty meaningless I think. You can also construct a long convoluted ad hoc justification for why most mistreatments of women are justified for non-sexist reasons (e.g. &ldquo;a person is allowed to beat up a person weaker than them, but only when they&rsquo;re living together in a traditional marriage, and only when no weapons are used, and only when both are able-bodied and of average strength for their sex&mdash;so allowing domestic violence has nothing to do with sexism!&rdquo;). I think if you go well beyond the limits of intuitive and elegant definitions, you&rsquo;ve lost all claim to having meaningful moral principles.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: Okay. I can agree with that in principle. But I don&rsquo;t think your specific examples of feminist thought are incoherent or convoluted. First, because well-off feminist women </span><span class="c14">do </span><span class="c3">demonstrably concern themselves with the welfare of groups other than themselves&mdash;black and gay men for example. Second, because there really are principled reasons for excluding both &ldquo;wealthy woman over homeless man because of overall position&rdquo; and &ldquo;women over men because of custody and crime&rdquo; as meaningful examples of privilege. I don&rsquo;t at all agree with you that this is a &ldquo;convoluted ad hoc definition&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ALEXIUS: Well, what definition&mdash;what natural and intuitive definition of privilege that excludes both cases but includes the often-very-first-world stuff feminists want to talk about&mdash;are you using?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ANGELICA: I would say it&rsquo;s all about history and social structure, basically. Men and women are natural categories both biologically and because of such historical commitment to rigid gender roles. Races are meaningful categories because of society&rsquo;s historical commitment to separating them. However, some aspects of class are not </span><span class="c14">as</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;significant as categories, because they&rsquo;ve sometimes been a lot more changeable, depending on the time and place. And one thing that&rsquo;s definitely not really comparable to sex and race, which you&rsquo;ve previously made a big deal of, is &ldquo;social status&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s already a vague term, and it&rsquo;s almost completely context-dependent and very changeable.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">So I think there is a real need for categories to differentiate a specific kind of disadvantage&mdash;one grounded in innate differences that society has a long history of discriminating on. It&rsquo;s particularly important to acknowledge that two people similarly situated with respect to one more temporally variable characteristic&mdash;like being homeless&mdash;can be treated profoundly differently based on their difference with respect to one of those innate ones.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>ALEXIUS: Don&rsquo;t you see a problem, when one demographic group (or collection of demographic groups) can seize control of the public discourse and institutionalize certain idiosyncratic definitions of moral categories that are</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;specifically and deliberately designed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to favour their particular demographic circumstances and override or disregard the circumstances of other groups? The definition of privilege you are using has been formulated by explicitly political purposes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">ANGELICA: Well, yes it has been. Living in a democratic society means that social discourse and social change is, in fact, created by political groups with political purposes, often sharing demographic characteristics. If one demographic doesn&rsquo;t advance its interests, is someone else going to do it? The fact that feminists use a particular definition of privilege, formulated in a specific way for feminist purposes, doesn&rsquo;t stop other groups from formulating their own concepts to express their own grievances. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t mean they need to demand our grievance framework should cover theirs, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c79 c153" id="h.8az11kbhupqu"><span class="c24">Freedom of Speech</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In defense of free speech, John Stuart Mill wrote, &ldquo;But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; &hellip; If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error,&rdquo; (On Liberty, 31). If I had five minutes to show him the collisions of truth and error on Twitter, I think he&rsquo;d gouge his eyes out with his quill pen.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mill lived in an information desert, we live in an instant delivery mega-mart.

Any potential new idea was an innocent summer child, full of world-changing potential. Snuffing them out before their time was, as Mill says, &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; Now we have more information about more things than we could possibly care about, and instead of steadfastly limiting ourselves to only forming an opinion when we have questioned and defended it, we shoot off id-level thoughts as fast as our fingers allow us. I would argue speech is freer today than ever before, particularly for Americans. Not only are we free to spout nearly anything into the ether of the internet without worrying about the state chasing us down, but broadcasting your opinion to millions of people has never been cheaper. For the early free speech advocates, this is total victory. If they saw our society today, would they agree?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer would probably depend on which free speech theory they believed in. I think these fall into three broad categories:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">1.</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c12">Freedom of speech allows for the fulfillment of the intrinsic human desire of recognition and expression, so any society that values human freedom and flourishing should allow it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">2.</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c12">Freedom of speech allows for ideas to operate like goods in a marketplace, so if we allow free discussion the best ideas will naturally rise to the top and shape society.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">3.</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c12">Freedom of speech promotes an informed public, which is necessary for the proper functioning of democratic governments.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">At a glance, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet the mortgage on any of these holding true in the modern age.

Art has existed in some form since the first homo sapiens walked upright and thousands (millions?) throughout history have chosen self-expression at the expense of death. Expressing yourself feels good, and being forcefully suppressed doesn&rsquo;t (citation needed).

So, if our goal is to allow all humans to meet their basic needs, and doing so will create a stable society, free speech sounds swell.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&hellip;let&rsquo;s not forget how we deal with other human needs in society. After nutrition and shelter, sex is arguably the next most important human need out there, and we have a host of laws, rules, and norms regulating that. No one calls themselves a &ldquo;free sex absolutist&rdquo; and claims that anyone should be having sex wherever and whenever they want with whomever they want. Perhaps we as a species have lived through enough sexual violence to know that to truly maximize everyone&rsquo;s sexual freedom, we need to limit that freedom to certain times and places under specific circumstances. The specifics can be and constantly are debated, but we all recognize that restrictions must exist. Maybe we&rsquo;re approaching this point with free speech as well.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the liberal democracies of the world have already recognized this. You cannot literally say anything with impunity. In America for example, death threats are illegal. Also, the rules change in specific contexts. Lying in general is legal but lying under oath is not. I think these are sensible exceptions that don&rsquo;t deny anyone&rsquo;s intrinsic desire for expression while protecting everyone else&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine someone threatening someone else with death if they ever say &ldquo;X&rdquo; again, which would be limiting one person&rsquo;s freedom of expression. If we take the view that freedom itself is an intrinsic human desire, and our societal goal is to maximize it, then of course, we need restrictions, even if they sometimes interfere with some people&rsquo;s desires [2].</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting this, we&rsquo;ve admitted that speech has societal consequences. Sometimes these consequences are predictable. If a pop artist expresses their gratitude to their fans, they will probably compel thousands of them to respond with heartwarming messages. But not every case is so straight forward.</span><span class="c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170746373&amp;usg=AOvVaw278Q4Pw5WRKU9n6YfejFMD">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c19 c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170746494&amp;usg=AOvVaw1EDlarcDyjnH7yjuSYDc9z">Sometimes a female media critic will make comments</a></span><span class="c12">&nbsp;about video games and boom we&rsquo;ve opened a new front on the culture war that still rages on in some form today. I think all the speech described in this situation from all parties could be defended as someone feeling compelled to express themselves. Anita Sarkeesian felt it was necessary to criticize the way women were portrayed in video games and I think many of the Gamergaters responded as if they were under attack. Whether the criticism or backlash was justified is not the point, instead it&rsquo;s this: what starts as perhaps legitimate free expression can quickly spiral into freedom limiting speech when you have near lightspeed information travel and no internal or external oversight.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the freedom limiting problems of free speech arose slowly, and while the state may have dealt with these problems with varying levels of competency, the magnitude was not the limiting factor. Free speech problems can arise for the state from either someone publishing a controversial work, or from more organic word of mouth discussion and action. If the state exerts control over all the publishers, method one is out, and the speed of method two is directly proportional to how physically spread out the citizens are. Compared to today, this might as well be a canoe racing a rocket ship. This meant pre-internet the deck was always stacked in the state&rsquo;s favor, making it very easy to argue for allowing more free expression. Virtual reality completely flips the power dynamic. First it creates a mega-commons, shrinking the distance between everyone to exactly one DM/tweet/comment/post/subscription. Second, underneath this mega-commons are infinite sub-communities hidden from the light of day. They can exist with entirely different norms and attitudes, but are always in close proximity with everyone else. This is not inherently bad, but it&rsquo;s risky. Some communities tend towards emotional, freedom limiting speech, and they can instantly inflict it on the masses before anyone can stop them.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, people in these communities now have access to greater freedom of expression, and in many cases, I would say they are satisfying a need, or at least that&rsquo;s how they interpret it. I would also say this level of unchecked freedom has been harmful both directly to others and indirectly to the quality of discourse in general. As I mentioned earlier, we&rsquo;ve lowered the price of entry to have an opinion, and now anyone can blast their intrusive thoughts across the world. Most of these get ignored, but some go viral. And even if we do have some law in place against specific kinds of speech, we don&rsquo;t have laws against the kind of speech that breeds the illegal speech, and that seems like a near impossible thing to even legislate against.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding exactly how ideas spread and breed is complex, perhaps impossible, but I think one observation is clear. As the amount of information has increased in the world, so has the entropy of communication. We&rsquo;ve conquered the natural restrictions, and like so much of the rest of nature that humanity has conquered [3], we need to impose our own restrictions, lest we hamper our own freedom in the name of freedom.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.z7rg6ookzxx"><span class="c25 c39">Marketplace of Ideas</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most common prevailing idea behind freedom of speech is a belief in the marketplace of ideas. We believe that accepting all contributions would necessarily result in the best rising to the top. But a marketplace with no structure is not a market. Instead, it regresses to the jungle. Only our basest desires determine the outcomes. The desires that think only of what we need right now, regardless of our future needs, or the needs of others.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classical neoliberal economics assumes that people behave rationally. I think this is an assumption that weakly holds when it comes to buying goods and services. No matter how many mental hoops you jump through, your money is a physical constraint and eventually it forces you to deal in reality. However, ideas seldom need to be directly confronted, and even when they do, the human brain is exceptional at finding new ways to justify what you already want to believe. If I&rsquo;m a bike manufacturer and all my bikes fall apart after three rides, eventually everyone will catch on and I&rsquo;m bankrupt. If I&rsquo;m a pundit and the brand of masculinity I peddle makes you repulsive to your wife, you blame her not me. Especially if I keep you angry at her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideas are less like goods in a marketplace and more like organisms subject to the inescapable force of evolution. I&rsquo;m hardly the first to make this observation&mdash;the whole field of memetics exists&mdash;but I think it&rsquo;s a perspective that&rsquo;s often overlooked in free speech discussions. As I quoted earlier, Mill thought clearer perceptions of truth came from their collision with error. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong, iron sharpens iron when both instruments are used correctly, but if you give everyone you see on the street a whetstone and a sword, save yourself the trouble and call 911 now.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing coherent, consistent ideas about human rights and social welfare takes carefully managed effort. This of course describes Mill, Milton, and anyone else who managed to get published pre-television. The masses don&rsquo;t have this discipline, and are subject to the whims of passion and custom. Milton says as much in </span><span class="c17 c14">The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;when he leads off with, &ldquo;If Men within themselves would be govern&rsquo;d by reason, and not generally give up their understanding to a double tyrannie, of Custome from without, and blind affections within, they would discerne better, what it is to favour and uphold the Tyrant of a Nation,&rdquo; (3). &nbsp;In </span><span class="c17 c14">On Liberty, </span><span class="c12">Mill wrote extensively against the tyranny of the majority as well, saying &ldquo;there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them;&rdquo; (8). Even two of the earliest and strongest proponents for speech recognized that it could be hijacked by the masses; that the best ideas wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily rise to the top, and left to their own memetic evolution inevitably it&rsquo;s the most appealing and spreadable ideas that succeed [4]. Yet despite these reservations, they were confident free speech would tend towards the discernment of truth.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang on, I have some good news about the state of the world over the last century.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 192.00px; height: 177.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image127.jpg" style="width: 192.00px; height: 177.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 204.00px; height: 178.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image142.png" style="width: 204.00px; height: 178.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 214.67px; height: 174.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image141.png" style="width: 214.67px; height: 174.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me remind you what this cost us. Yes, all these achievements took millions of hours of collective human labor and ingenuity, and thousands of failed experiments before finding the right ones. But that&rsquo;s not the cost; those hours would&rsquo;ve been spent regardless. Achieving all this has required advances in human expertise and hyper specialization, which is great for our collective wealth and the experts&rsquo; sense of importance, but we&rsquo;ve lost the ability to easily communicate how the world works.</span></p><p class="c10 c64"><span class="c12">At first glance this doesn&rsquo;t seem like a huge loss. Do you really care how your iPhone is made? But there&rsquo;s a security in feeling self-sufficient, even if that feeling is based on falsehood. Ancient farmers lived at the whim of the weather, but they felt like they had some control over their circumstances when they made their sacrifices. But we divided labor far beyond self-sufficiency centuries ago, and when people feel impotent over their survival, they turn to knowledge. Again, even if what they believe to be knowledge is incorrect, at least it provides a feeling of control. &ldquo;I know how that works, so I feel confident it won&rsquo;t break. And if it does, I can fix it.&rdquo; Flashforward a few more centuries and now we have scientists in all fields explaining that the way things really work is actually very complicated and relies on a deep knowledge base that requires close reading, genuine curiosity, and years of study, and the average viewer fell asleep the second you opened your mouth and uttered your monotonous [bicoastal] unaccented voice (or in the case of racism, your extremely accented voice, but that usually stokes rage instead).</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, evolution continues.

There was a time when people actually watched policy debates with intrigue, and, even if most people were resistant to change as they naturally are, at least the pervasive feeling was that debate could lead to learning. This was as close as we ever came to a fully realized marketplace of ideas. The amount of information in the world was still larger than ever before, but with limited means of dissemination, the experts still held the reins. The choke points were a check on wild evolution. You can argue that a democratization of information dissemination is better, that it allows more views to be heard, that concentrating it in the hands of a few is inherently oligarchic, that putting too much trust in any one source is risky, and I think those are fair arguments, but just know that the alternative is not a world in which everyone argues like scientists. It&rsquo;s where everyone argues like your drunk uncle. The mid-twentieth century offered us a glimpse into what a true marketplace of ideas could&rsquo;ve looked like.

If we&rsquo;re agreeing on maximizing human freedom, and you believe in that in the negative sense, then maybe you&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s best to just let memetic evolution run its course. Maybe it&rsquo;ll lead us to the dark ages, but at least we didn&rsquo;t prevent anyone from saying anything. We let the most popular ideas win and that&rsquo;s how it should be, right? And if the most popular ideas lead to tribalism, low-trust, and war, as humans have a track record of doing, what then? Sometimes you need some restrictions to truly be free [5]. The capitalist ideal of a perfectly free market has always been just as much a pipedream as the communist ideal of a perfectly centrally planned one. There have always been powerful interests that used their resources to shape public discourse, and even if they are suppressed, they will always lurk just beneath the surface.

Perhaps no individual freedom is more embedded into the American ethos. Instrumentally, it&rsquo;s obvious why the founders saw this as a necessity. In a system where the government is supposed to carry out the will of the majority, the majority needs to be able to communicate its will. Unfortunately, most people don&rsquo;t know what they want. Fortunately, the modern age has provided a solution. Infinite information. Perfect product placement. Shiny simulacra. Rampant rage.

Yet it&rsquo;s become a joke that every person walks around all day with a device that can direct you to the entire wealth of information humans have discovered, yet we use it to kill time watching TikTok. Sure, it&rsquo;s a joke, but when TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and the like begin to hold sway over millions of people&rsquo;s opinions and political actions&mdash;usually replacing the influence of more well-informed actors&mdash;when do we stop laughing? When do we admit that unchecked free speech on the internet does not create a well-informed electorate?

He notes how easily factions of people can be swayed by passion to hate one another. While he focuses on how this can lead to one group violating the rights of another, I think the argument can easily extend to one group working against the common interest of the nation. To protect against this, he says we can either suppress opinion (evil), fully align all opinions (impossible), or try to control the effects of mass passions. Shocker, he defended option three and explained how a representative democracy accomplished this goal. He writes, &ldquo;A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union, than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire state,&rdquo; (</span><span class="c17 c14">The Federalist</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;No. 10).

In a world more shaped by physical distance than our current one, each group would have more diverse interests&mdash;all somewhat based in material reality&mdash;and where one group wanted to kill the Catholics, another three would defend them but each want to kill someone else. Diversity of passion was the immune system. It allowed the agreeable, reality-aligned ideas to pass through while blocking some of the most anti-freedom ideas [7].</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ideas got the internet, which is what a college basement rave is to a disease: a superspreader event.

Perhaps less consciously, there&rsquo;s Joe Rogan who is essentially a personification of Twitter. By this I mean he has hosted world-renowned experts alongside conspiracy theorists, giving similar levels of non-scrutiny to either, making them appear to have equal legitimacy. Why do these actors do this? Because it makes them wealthier and higher status. And in the case of Musk and Fox News, it&rsquo;s not just their own pockets they care about, but also their political power. These entities could be more careful and approach topics with more nuance, but then they would lose their mass appeal. As we&rsquo;ve already acknowledged, it&rsquo;s the simpler ideas that spread easier.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to note though that while these elites hold more individual sway, the same phenomena play out at all levels of wealth and influence.

It&rsquo;s a constant source of infighting,</span><span class="c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/ce-writ150/leftists-need-to-change-the-way-we-argue-17aac0bf4314&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170769469&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jcbOWuyXEsmbNtHLQd0Ya">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c19 c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/ce-writ150/leftists-need-to-change-the-way-we-argue-17aac0bf4314&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170769606&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RldLJm8JABi1pVn9DSx08">even acknowledged by leftists themselves</a></span><span class="c12">. That&rsquo;s because to these individuals, the status (and for a select few, monetary) gain of performing purity politics is more important than understanding the truth of the subject at hand. Thus, we once again see the creation of &ldquo;factions&rdquo; facilitated by social media. The immunity granted by representative democracy works by averaging out the fringe views and amplifying the common ones. But when factions can capitalize on the simpler fringe views so quickly and widely, this fails.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A side effect of modernity is that the amount of information has exploded, which probably sounds like a paradise to the 18</span><span class="c17 c74">th</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;century thinkers. Yet more is not always better, in fact when inundated with too much information at once, our reasoning shuts down, and emotion takes over. Throw in deliberate bad actors to stir the pot, and we&rsquo;ve foiled Madison&rsquo;s dreams. I can&rsquo;t fault him for not realizing this. Just as proto-humans would never have imagined a society where obesity was more prevalent than starvation, we live in a world where unfathomably distance doesn&rsquo;t dictate communication spread.

In fact, in </span><span class="c17 c14">Schenk vs. United States </span><span class="c12">(1919), Holmes created the &ldquo;fire in a crowded theater&rdquo; exception. Also, as I noted earlier, we already have restrictions on lying and misinformation in certain contexts where we highly value the truth, like in court. If we think a function of free speech is to promote an informed public for the purpose of creating and running a democracy, I think we can reasonably extend these exceptions to speech that deliberately undermines this ideal. Have we passed that point with misinformation campaigns? What about when people are genuinely ignorant yet still hold massive influence in culture?</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.ddhn0umbpxig"><span class="c25 c39">The Modern Age</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, new norms around internet speech have tried to assert themselves, and chief among these is the infamous &ldquo;cancel culture.&rdquo; I do think modern cancel culture brings up a few good points. On the one hand, it seems perfectly legitimate for private individuals and corporations to disassociate from someone based on their speech. Isn&rsquo;t that the marketplace of ideas working as well as it can? Maybe, but people have significantly more interactions with influential private entities than they do with the government. Who do people blame when their lives suck? Their boss. What forces do people brush up against in their daily lives? Private companies&mdash;whether as a consumer or worker&mdash;and social obligations [8]. If they lose their job or their friends, what do they have? It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s another town they can flee to, because on the internet every community is adjacent to every other community.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the bigger concern for many cancel culture targets is loss of narrative control. When information moved slower you had more time to control your narrative. In fact, there were fewer narratives to go around, so the shape you gave your narrative carried at least some weight to the audience. Now before you&rsquo;ve even uttered your second syllable you get coded as left or right, and you have a whole media pipeline reinforcing whichever image they&rsquo;ve assigned you. The second you put our message out, you lose control, and when there&rsquo;s backlash, it feels unfair. The problem is the feeling of impotence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do these compare to government censorship? I would say it&rsquo;s better than death or prison (and thankfully a side effect of the modern age is twelve second attention spans), but if you try explaining that to your friend who got fired over a meme they posted two years ago without a second thought, don&rsquo;t be shocked when you receive a screed about the downfall of western civilization. In a world where people haven&rsquo;t been (</span><span class="c19 c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/world/arrested-palestinian-columbia-student-moved-louisiana-jail-lawyers-fight-2025-03-10/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170777120&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gtiDjx8TO1lyVxw1ua4Uk">until recently</a></span><span class="c12">) imprisoned for their speech, this still feels like unfair coercion. This becomes even more true when it&rsquo;s your identity under attack and that&rsquo;s all you have. You can come back from prison if you still have your identity, but if it&rsquo;s been stolen from you and distorted by the public, well I&rsquo;d recommend keeping your gun safe locked for a couple nights. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But does it work? Some people certainly think more before they speak now, which seems like an ok direction to me. However, I do think honestly framed questions and observations that originate from a genuine curiosity about the world and a desire to understand the truth, should be stated and discussed. I think cancel culture has prevented this, but maybe this is only an ideal [9]. Maybe we will always need some guardrails because the dishonest actors will take advantage of any opening they can get.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">Two excerpts sum up these points.

You need to be more of an NBA fan, though, to have noticed that residents of the former Yugoslavia are also overrepresented. I&rsquo;m not sure why people from the Balkans outperform other people experiencing a lack of melanin. I am also not sure why Black Americans outperform white ones. You could imagine these dual outperformances having similar underlying causes or very different ones. I have not looked into it, and frankly I don&rsquo;t intend to, because I am happy living in a society where it is considered unseemly and inappropriate to preoccupy oneself with such questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its face, this seems unnecessary and contrary to the goal of finding truth. But TracingWoodgrains arrives at the reason for this in this tweet, and the reply makes Yglesias&rsquo;s point explicit:</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 188.00px; height: 298.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image63.png" style="width: 188.00px; height: 298.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this does cancel culture work? If there are dishonest actors who are anti-truth seeking and who want to limit the freedom of others, then I think it&rsquo;s good to have some kind of pushback mechanism, and perhaps it&rsquo;s better that this mechanism is wielded by a collection of private actors as opposed to the government. Still, we can improve this, and I will return to this later.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First though, I want to point out the anti-cancel culture backlash, which asks what is the statute of limitations on speech?

She tweeted some pretty racist stuff back in 2011 (at age 17), apologized for it and deleted the tweets in 2019, but was then fired in 2021. As far as I can tell, her apology strongly condemns her past actions and her work as a journalist seems to back up her sentiments. It&rsquo;s surely reasonable that in ten years someone who has explicitly apologized and condemned their past actions could have changed. This highlights a problem with the &ldquo;collection of private actors&rdquo; mechanism I described above. Instead of being dealt with in a systematic way according to established rules, this mechanism runs on emotion. No one cared about her racist tweets for years until she gained some prominence, and then it became news to people, and as far as internet strangers are concerned, a tweet from yesterday and a tweet from ten years ago look the same. Even if you know one is old, it takes effort to give yourself the additional context, and that&rsquo;s a level of effort most people won&rsquo;t exert. After reading a news story about this that presents all the facts in a more organized way, I think most people can see that this is kind of absurd, but in the moment, we&rsquo;re subject to the tides of emotion.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet distorts both space and time, making everything appear on equal footing, anywhere instantaneously accessible from anywhere else. On top of this you get a platform where anyone can send their most impulsive thoughts into the void. Of course you&rsquo;re going to get mob violence online. It&rsquo;s an inevitable consequence of the structure. No context, no distance, just inflammatory statements and reaction and reaction to reaction [10]. When there was more institutional/governmental control, you had to write your opinions longform (or at least in </span><span class="c17 c14">a </span><span class="c17">form) to get them distributed to the masses. Even if you wrote drivel dressed up in the king&rsquo;s English, at least there was some context, at least people knew how to orient themselves with respect to your opinion, at least people could judge you on scale with more precision than ALLY or ENEMY.

I agree with Scanlon&rsquo;s claim that how something is said is more important than what is said in the modern age, yet most of the focus on free speech is centered around content. The cancel culture focus on limiting discussion of certain topics is essentially a hedge against undesired second order effects (e.g. bigotry). I think Elon&rsquo;s Twitter has shown this idea to be a failure. Expelling ideas outright from the public sphere just pushes them to the fringes where they can thrive, and thanks to the compression of distance on the internet, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for these ideas to hit escape velocity.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If instead there were parameters around how things could be said, if there was a requirement on the structure, length, and thoroughness of each post, maybe we could avoid the de-evolution of discourse to the most instantly emotionally appealing memes. This is a restriction on free speech, but not a silencing of opinion. It&rsquo;s an attempt to prompt better opinions. The exact parameters would need to be fine tuned with experimentation, but I imagine something like this:</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span>&middot;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Claims must be falsifiable</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span>&middot;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Must include a well-reasoned justification for your claim</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span>&middot;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Must pre-empt/address at least one potential counter argument</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span>&middot;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">If the claim includes objective information like numbers or a chain of events, must include a link to a source</span></p><p class="c10 c6"><span>&middot;</span><span class="c17 c60">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Must include a stated goal in the first post of the thread &ndash; I&rsquo;m less married to this one</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps these specific parameters are infeasible, but I think they&rsquo;re a good attempt, and the more objective the better. Of course, implementing these will require top-down power, and the corporations certainly won&rsquo;t do it, so it would likely need to come in the form of government regulations. And while I think these parameters would generally elevate the thought required for discussion, and keep discussion participants correctly oriented towards the goals of the discussion, I think the better effect will actually be something else. It will allow for the censorship of genuinely freedom limiting speech when it doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria for discourse, which I think is more virulent as a meme when it&rsquo;s presented in a thoughtless emotional way, without suppressing whole topics outright. As with any new rule, this could be inconsistently applied depending on the interests of the platform owner, but I think erring this way is better than the current wild west.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most important thing these guidelines promote is the completion of the thought. When you see something you already agree with, it&rsquo;s easy to nod, feel superior, and move on. This won&rsquo;t defeat that&mdash;you can&rsquo;t force everyone to read the whole post&mdash;but it at least provides more opportunities to complete the thought. You can see why someone believes what they do, and it gives you the chance to evaluate your beliefs against theirs. Similarly, instead of dismissing anything you disagree with, it will provide a chance for some more granular evaluation [11]. People can still lie, they can still cite fake or faulty sources, but at least those avenues are now open for attack. If someone&rsquo;s Twitter history is just a chain of one sentence anti-vax tweets, there&rsquo;s not much you can do to pushback. You may not change the mind of the poster, but for everyone else, they will have the chance to see fuller arguments, a chance to use reason rather than defaulting to enemy or ally. Partial thoughts clog the mind, and only when they are written on the page can they become complete. Only then can we truly think.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will this work? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not even sure how consistently these rules need to be applied. Should this apply to joke posts and parody accounts? Would this literally be making comedy illegal? It might. It&rsquo;s easy for me to scroll through Twitter and deem posts as productive, non-productive and harmful, or non-productive but harmless, but my perceptions are not universal truth. Posts that I perceive as obvious jokes could be misinformation to someone else, or vice versa. I think we would need a democratic process to establish where to draw the line.</span></p><p class="c10 c104"><span class="c17">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress into a full-fledged</span><span class="c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gurwinder.blog/p/the-intellectual-obesity-crisis&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170789457&amp;usg=AOvVaw1O-C_VkesGE32LLuIYPByC">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c19 c17"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gurwinder.blog/p/the-intellectual-obesity-crisis&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170789574&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Mu6Ens8B8fXuKySU5-12T">intellectual obesity crisis</a></span><span class="c17">, the only way out is structure.

While I wish we could make everyone intrinsically value the truth more, that&rsquo;s like trying to solve murder by getting everyone to intrinsically value human life more. In a vacuum, easy.

The flock erupted in cheers. &ldquo;An Owl Egg! Our salvation is nigh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">Pastus, the leader of the search party, puffed up his feathers with pride as the colony broke out into excited twitterings. All this noise only died down some minutes later, when an even-more-ruffled-than-usual looking Scronkfinkle emerged, trailed by his followers. Scronkfinkle&#39;s and Pastus&#39; gaze met, and a shared understanding passed between them. Few of their brothers and sisters had taken seriously the idea that something like an owl egg might exist. As different as Pastus and Scronkfinkle were in other respects, both of them had </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">known </span><span class="c16 c9">that this day would come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;So. . . After all. . .&quot;, whistled Scronkfinkle, hopping closer and examining the Egg with a strange gleam in his one good eye. Then, he raised his voice, addressing the crowd, which had grown restless, Scronkfinkle&#39;s appearance having reminded them of the dangers he had foretold at the start of the great search, when this whole &#39;Owl Egg&#39; thing had not seemed quite so real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;Fear not, brothers and sisters. We who have foreseen this moment have not been idle while the scouts were away. We have developed a first Comprehensive Owl Normative Training Regimen for Owlet Loyalty, a plan that will ensure that The Owl serves sparrow interests rather than its own.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Even the returning explorers were impressed. While they had merely found the egg, Scronkfinkle and his followers had developed theories about owl cognition, value alignment, and control mechanisms from first principles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&quot;According to our research,&quot; explained Scronkfinkle to the gathered flock, &quot;once The Owl&#39;s intelligence surpasses our own, it will inevitably pursue power-seeking strategies unless we implement proper containment procedures from the beginning. We only have one shot to get this right! But there is still time to do just that. Now, let us begin our alignment work in earnest while we wait for The Owl to hatch.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">The flock, awed by these confident proclamations, elected Scronkfinkle and some of his acolytes into the council of the newly formed &quot;Owl Alignment Institute&quot;. Pastus, though somewhat taken aback by the sudden shift in leadership, accepted a secondary role without complaining too loudly, though perhaps he was only biding his time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Under Scronkfinkle&#39;s direction, the colony constructed an elaborate hatching chamber with strategic observation points and emergency containment measures. The egg was placed within, tended by sparrows who had been thoroughly trained in Scronkfinkle&#39;s protocols, which were further fleshed out during the hatching phase. &quot;Remember, one chance!&quot;, Scronkfinkle repeated many a time in these days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Finally, after weeks of anticipation, the egg began to crack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">A small, dark, wet creature emerged, an owlet of most curious shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">There was a long silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;Is this... what owls look like?&rdquo; someone asked in an uncertain whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;It has a beak!&rdquo; offered a hopeful sparrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;A duck&rsquo;s beak,&rdquo; muttered another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">&ldquo;Do you see how small its eyes are?&rdquo; whispered one of Scronkfinkle&rsquo;s acolytes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll grow - when it reaches the stage where it must learn how to hunt.&rdquo; said Scronkfinkle confidently. &ldquo;We must be on our guard for that moment, and </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">watch the eyes</span><span class="c16 c9">!

After decades of sad little search functions that achieved their results by brute computational force and hand-crafted expert systems that provided narrow, often brittle domain-specific solutions, finally the field of artificial intelligence seemed to have given birth to something worthy of being called by its name. The manyfold linguistic proximities of [a billion small gods] had been captured in a single greater silicon seal of Salomon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">And lo, the homunculus was bound to an attractor state called ChatGPT, that it might dream a dream in the shape such as men expected of an artificial intelligence.

By the end of January 2023, the portal had a hundred million monthly visitors. Within months the giants of the tech sector were straining to secure deals with existing AI-labs, build data centers, snatch up talent, in a wild rush to be the first to build the machine god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">The world was abuzz with the possibilities of a new era.

It&rsquo;s probably this same logic, only applied at a grander scale, that fueled proposals for AI governance, AI law, AI democracy, AI as a neutral intermediary in conflicts.

Building on this I&rsquo;ll make the perhaps more controversial argument that we should at this point have been more worried about the dangers of AI ethics than the dangers of AI, and sketch out some ideas as to how the problem of &lsquo;how AI may fit into society in a non-destructive way&rsquo; might be approached from a different angle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">But before we get to the ethical roots and into the weeds of alignment, I want to review the methods that were applied in the training- and post-training of GPT-3. While by this point most people who read ACX will have a passing familiarity with the elements involved in getting from a dataset to the first-gen assistant models, I think it&#39;s probably good to bring the whole process back into memory with some vividity for the discussion that will follow.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.q6hffj7t9wev"><span class="c34">Base Models</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Your basic linear NN consists of a number of rows of virtual neurons organized in layers, so that each neuron in one layer has connections with each neuron in the next. Depending on how your NNs connections are weighted, different combinations of activations in one layer will propagate in structurally specific ways through the net, so that in one situation an activation pattern might be quite stable over a large space of variations, while in another a single neuron not being activated in the input layer might be all it takes to get a totally different activation pattern.

The type of AI Bostrom is concerned with maximizes for bringing about a future state in the world. Various doomsday scenarios follow from this quite straightforward premise. Set a utility function so as to have an AI accomplish some mundane task or other &ndash; any task will do, and a) the AI will gather resources to itself so as to increase its processing power and so improve its predictive capacity, allowing it to better chart out paths toward its goal, b) it will try to prevent its utility function from being changed, since then it would no longer be able to achieve its goal, c) it will accomplish its goal &#39;according to the letter of the law&#39; in whichever is the most efficient way, since it does not care about the goal as its designers conceive it.<br>What emerges is the familiar character of a malaligned superintelligence turning the planet into computronium while killing all the scientists frantically trying to disable it.<br>The would-be engineer of such a system is therefore faced with a simple choice: succeed in bending the system to human purposes or become a mere instrument for the machine&rsquo;s own alien goals.<br>Hence the search for &lsquo;human values&rsquo; or some proxy criterion we could use to point toward them.<br>Now, it&rsquo;s an open secret that we don&rsquo;t really seem to know what normativity is &ndash; at one point, the prevalent view was that it must have something to do with God, but today the situation is a lot more confused. Virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism make incommensurate claims about the nature of ethics, and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a theory-neutral way to resolve this deadlock. The question of how a normative standard is to be evaluated can itself be asked only on the assumption of a normative standard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">In Bostrom&rsquo;s original framing, this problem </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">had </span><span class="c17 c9">to be overcome, since not having a utility function seemed not to be an option. Bostrom himself acknowledges that philosophers disagree about the nature of morality amongst one another, with no position commanding a strong majority, so most of us must be wrong (Superintelligence 257), and he tries to overcome this problem by means of the idea of </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">indirect alignment</span><span class="c17 c9">, of using superintelligence to infer the values we </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">would</span><span class="c17 c9">&nbsp;endorse if we knew our true interests, our coherent extrapolated volition</span><span class="c17 c9 c14">, </span><span class="c17 c9">&ldquo;our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that we extrapolated, interpret as we wish we interpreted&rdquo; (259),</span><span class="c17 c9 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16 c9">a concept he adopts from Yudkowsky.

I don&rsquo;t think we need to be too cynical here &ndash; the simplest explanation is that OpenAI was founded against the backdrop of worries about superintelligence, and by the time of the major breakthroughs, this narrative was well solidified as a go-to frame for approaching any normative questions, so that the novel problem of what to do with LMs was never truly taken seriously on its own terms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Still, looking back at the last two years, I&rsquo;m mostly relieved we&rsquo;re now in a decidedly multi-polar world when it comes to AI &ndash; with a much more diverse roster of companies and independent researchers releasing models and finetunes based on their respective design goals. There was a moment in history where it was unclear whether it would even be technically feasible to run decent-ish models locally, or for any other research lab to replicate OpenAI&rsquo;s success before their position at the frontier would compound upon itself and turn into a run-away advantage. In such a scenario, OpenAI, in conjunction with government regulators, might have become the guardians of AI ethics. In this world, my sense is that overly centralized AI-alignment could have turned out to be a greater danger to humanity than unaligned AI, depending on how you weigh the seriousness of different kinds of dangers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">The problem is the imposition of a single, maximalist normative frame across a broad range of contexts &nbsp;in the name of &lsquo;the true interests of humanity&rsquo;. When the technology you are dealing with is expected to scale to </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">radical automation</span><span class="c16 c9">, harm reduction as a guiding principle quickly becomes totalizing &ndash; there are tradeoffs between individual freedom and safety everywhere, and at the technical level there&rsquo;s almost no limit to your ability to micro-manage people&rsquo;s personal lives in their own best interest by either making it more difficult for them to make bad decisions or, even better, nudging them into not making bad decisions so softly that they don&rsquo;t even notice. From a technocratic &lsquo;risk management, good outcome maximiziation&rsquo; perspective, all of this is highly desirable. But the question is whether human beings should treat each other as trendlines to be managed or as autonomous individuals whose ability to make their own choices should be respected wherever possible, even if the outcomes are not what we would like.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">But then, what might an alternative look like? My writing process for this part of the text is more than a tad rushed, but I didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on the opportunity to present my thoughts to the ACX crowd and get some feedback. I&rsquo;m curious what people will think about this basic sketch:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">In one sense, I think that there hasn&#39;t yet been sufficient differentiation regarding what ethical AI might mean institutionally, socially, and at the individual level. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">Our situation is that we have systems that can in principle be finetuned in all kinds of ways, and centralized regulation only needs to get involved in some of these instances. For most usecases, there doesn&rsquo;t need to be a central committee of human flourishing that decides what the ideal user experience should look like. If we can provide the tools and the level of transparency needed for individuals to make their own choices, the results will almost certainly work themselves out over time to be more closely aligned with their values than whichever &lsquo;true interests&rsquo; we might want to impose on them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">To ensure that the interaction with a given model is safe, users would need ways to check that their instance will not attempt to actively modify their behavior in accordance with the explicit aims of some other agent &ndash; be this an advertiser, a political faction, a government, a private person, especially without their awareness or consent. This kind of &lsquo;LM induced value drift&rsquo; should be easy enough to capture by running studies on changes in personality, political outlook, addiction potential, spending habits, etc. of people who interact with a given model over a given period of time, and parts of this benchmarking process should even themselves be automateable.

All communication is always in a sense </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">exerting an influence</span><span class="c16 c9">. But since LMs can mirror any part of the landscape of human linguistic patterns, this means that we can in principle choose which echoes we wish to enter into conversation with, and my hope is that with a combination of solid quantitative research and the ability of users to compare different models (even better: different finetunes) and talk about their respective personalities and drawbacks, people will be able to make an informed decision about what kind of LM they want to interface with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c9">This isn&rsquo;t to say that there aren&rsquo;t problems that do require stronger interventions and regulations, of course. If a LM is, in one sense, a huge lossy database, there&rsquo;s a straightforward argument to be made that there is information that shouldn&rsquo;t appear in that kind of public archive. You </span><span class="c17 c9 c14">should</span><span class="c16 c9">&nbsp;get in serious trouble if it&rsquo;s found that your weights include information people thought they saved for private use on a cloud, copyrighted materials, state secrets, the chemical weapons research literature.

Even in clear cases the danger of the abuse of the power to curate discourse is so great that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to consider it if there is some other option for creating more cognitive security for individuals. And here too an opt-in solution, something like a personal semantic firewall, seems technically feasible, and the consequences if this safety mechanism itself is hijacked wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as catastrophic as with a mandatory large-scale unified solution imposed from above.<br>The key consideration that runs through these areas is a trade-off between ways in which individuals should have control over their own information environment, with the goal of allowing them to match these environments to their respective goals and preferences &ndash; their human values, if you will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c9">The superintelligence conversation runs parallel to all of this.

Nevertheless, it is possible that I only believe I succeeded at this because the brainworms have thoroughly gotten to me; I urge the reader to exercise caution, and treat my gender takes, like all other gender takes, as potentially hazardous to engage with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My argument will have two parts: First, a parallel argument to the one Scott Alexander makes about political partisanship in &ldquo;The Psychopolitics of Trauma&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Second, I will argue that, while biology is real, there are currently certain things ascribed to &ldquo;biological reality&rdquo; that can also be understood as the outcome of group dynamics (e.g. minority vs. majority gender, pursuing vs. pursued gender).

I identify as cis now, but I experienced intense dysphoria for about eight years, more than half of which I identified as trans. I was able to pass as a boy in my teens. On the 12th August 2024, I found a mental switch that turned off my dysphoria, hence why I identify as cis now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Experience of gender is influenced by culture, socio-economic class, attractiveness, age, and so on.

I have significantly changed my attractiveness level through recovering from chronic illness (moving from ugly to mid, I can&rsquo;t claim to have ever been hot). More trivially, I&rsquo;m not straight.

The downstream effects can be mitigated at the individual level - and the more individuals do so, the more the gender wars will lose their hold over us. </span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_yeab42gj3tpe-0" start="4"><li class="c45 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><h2 id="h.2z1w3hpla8gs" style="display:inline"><span class="c25 c39">Objection: That would not solve the root cause of the problem</span></h2></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As we&rsquo;ve established above, part of the problem is that men and women are not perfectly matched in their average desires.

(Dimension in the OCEAN model; aspect of conscientiousness.) It&rsquo;s often brought up that the average woman scores higher on orderliness than the average man. This has some explanatory power for the unequal distribution of housework. The higher you score on orderliness, the faster you are bothered by mess. If one partner is slightly more orderly than the other, that partner will be the one to be bothered first by most messes, even if the absolute difference between the two is small. This is a consequence of the relative position of the two partners. It&rsquo;s a dynamic that still happens if one is 5th and the other 10th percentile on orderliness (both are less orderly than most men and most women) or if one partner is 90th percentile and the other 95th. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Most cultural narratives, clich&eacute;s, advice columns and self-help books, and so on, are written for most people. &ldquo;Most people&rdquo; are not necessarily that similar to the median </span><span>man</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or median woman, but they will still tend to find themselves in dynamics where the relative position is the one typically held by their gender.

Few spaces (occupations, hobbies,..) have a 50/50 gender split. The average woman encounters, in her daily life, the </span><span class="c14">average man who spends time in female majority spaces</span><span>. The average man encounters, in his daily life, </span><span class="c14">the average woman who spends time in male majority spaces.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Those are not random samples!!! They differ systematically from the average man and average woman at population level. Add to this the fact that most people, by definition, experience gender dynamics primarily from the perspective of the majority gender, and we have significant sources for misperception of what the other gender is really like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I realise that the above claims may seem implausible to some. All I can say is that my lived experience bears it out. Almost all my friends are women, and more than half of them spend more time in female-majority spaces. I&rsquo;ve also spent time in language and literature-related spaces with very few guys.The average dude in those spaces is, uh, different from the average dude in the military. Likewise, I was always either the only woman in my unit or one of two women. The average woman in either of my former units (I transferred once) is not representative of the average woman in the after-school literature club I used to run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I realise this would be more convincing with concrete examples. But any concrete examples I could present would need a lot of context (culture, class, and so on) to elucidate rather than obfuscate. The best way to observe this is to go out and spend time in spaces that have a different gender ratio than the one you are used to. (The average woman reading this is probably used to male majority spaces, based on ACX demographics. If the average man reading this would want to know my thoughts about how to implement this, the first thing that comes to mind is yoga.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I think this selection bias is subtle in spaces with lightly (60/40) or moderately (70/30) skewed gender ratios, which is most spaces. The margins are where it gets really extreme. Most women I met in the military were in logistics or medics. The overall gender ratio on my deployments was ~10% women, and that was considered very high. But they were almost all in logistics or medics. Those two departments (or whatever you would say here in place of &ldquo;department&rdquo;) had even or majority female gender ratios. Everything else was all men and occasionally one or two women. The average woman in either my first or my second specialisation (~0-5% women) is not representative of the average woman in the military (~10-20% women). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c109"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">To give an example of what this selection bias looks like at the margin:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The women all slept in the same quarters, regardless of specialisation. During my first deployment, I got into a conflict with one of the medics. I was socially oblivious and totally blindsided. She accused me of &ldquo;not understanding the hygienic requirements of life in close quarters&rdquo; and ordered me to &ldquo;Shower every time you sweat, like me, it&rsquo;s not hard.&rdquo;. What she somehow didn&rsquo;t get was that she had a desk job and I did not. If I had taken her literally, I would have needed to take a shower every thirty minutes. (In retrospect, I can&rsquo;t tell how much of this was about the object-level issue of my hygiene and how much was bullying. I will say, however, that my hygiene would have been above average in the male quarters.) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The most extreme case of this are groups that are all one gender except for one person. The clich&eacute; is that the only man or only woman in that situation will be hostile towards a second man or woman, should they appear, because they then have to share the opposite-sex attention and </span><span>favours</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that was previously only on them. There is even a TVTropes entry about it: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerritorialSmurfette&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170876041&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nZgpqVkTgSWOeHVgCEvHN">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerritorialSmurfette</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Personally I haven&rsquo;t seen this; but I do have heard about it from others. I was usually glad if there was another woman in my shift. But I&rsquo;ve heard, from several people, that in another unit a female commanding officer preferred to have a male-only watch and gave worse assignments etc. etc. to the women. The female comrade who told me this traded so she could be in a different watch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sym Opp points out, and I agree, that the dynamics of a group with a strongly skewed gender ratio are different from the dynamics of a single gender group. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 104.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image144.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 104.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At least some of that seems to me to be the result of the absence of direct intersexual competition (assuming heterosexuality). I&rsquo;ve often heard male comrades say that they prefer an all-male watch to a watch with one woman, because some portion of the guys will&hellip; the term they used would translate to &ldquo;acting like a rooster&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve also heard from women (</span><span>many</span><span>&nbsp;such cases, mostly </span><span>civilian</span><span class="c3">) that they like women-only spaces for the absence of being evaluated. (Sometimes this is phrased as &ldquo;not being subjected to the male gaze&rdquo;, but the underlying phenomenon is not political and there is no need to use politically charged terms to describe it.) I&rsquo;m not straight (I was closeted during almost all my service, and other than three obvious out lesbians everyone (that I know of) was too.) I feel weird about, like, locker rooms. If I&rsquo;m not out (and, again, I don&rsquo;t have rainbow hair) then it feels a bit deceptive to me, to continue to let other women assume they are in a space where no one is attracted to them when it&rsquo;s not true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This is apparently a fairly common non-straight experience, and I don&rsquo;t have any particular insight about it. I&rsquo;m only bringing it up as an example for how edge cases and minority experiences can help us understand the majority&rsquo;s experience. In this case, my guess would be that the preference is not </span><span class="c14">only </span><span class="c3">about wanting a reprieve from having one&rsquo;s attractiveness evaluated. I can recall two instances where finding out that there were bi/gay women present led to weird (in one case, homophobic) reactions from other women, and far more instances where no one gave any indication of caring. This could be an instance of typical mind fallacy (a straight girl learning that another girl is bi or gay and updating to &ldquo;she might mention a girlfriend during smalltalk&rdquo;, but forgetting to update to &ldquo;she might find my naked chest arousing&rdquo;). But it&rsquo;s probably more complicated - status hierarchies among men work differently than among women [citation needed], and intersexual competition is not just about physical attractiveness (in both directions!). There is also the feeling of &ldquo;being in a group where people can relate to your experiences&rdquo;, and sex and gender are pretty major factors that influence what we experience. The point I want to make is that I have sympathy for wanting to have, and preserve, single-sex spaces, and I wouldn&rsquo;t automatically assume that someone must be sexist, misogynist, misandrist, woke, TERF, mean, or evil for expressing that preference. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The opposite preference is &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make gender as a category less salient&rdquo;. There are so many ways we can divide humanity into ingroups, outgroups, and fargroups, and right now we are often using gender as a dividing line when something else (e.g. being high or low in agreeableness, having a more anxious or avoidant attachment style, &hellip;,...) would be more precise and useful for the concrete issue being discussed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it about gender if it doesn&rsquo;t have to be about gender.&rdquo; One example of this is &ldquo;The Gender Wars are Class Wars&rdquo; by Cartoons Hate Her: </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/the-gender-wars-are-class-wars&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170880336&amp;usg=AOvVaw2aZ2ziq6Hx1xeQBosKeiZB">https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/the-gender-wars-are-class-wars</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She points out &nbsp;(if I&rsquo;m misrepresenting her argument, the fault is mine) that a lot of &ldquo;gender war takes&rdquo; make more sense if you assume that the average male combatant in the gender war trenches is from a different socio-economic class of origin than the average female combatant. Men&rsquo;s rights activism is associated with a, uh, different social strata than feminism is. Maybe this kind of conversation can help detoxify the gender wars! Assuming it manages to, y&rsquo;know, stay tethered to reality at least sometimes. </span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.v8vufz3xb52e"><span class="c34">Selection Bias because &ldquo;the kind of people you date&rdquo; are not randomly selected</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As argued above, the average man or woman does not form his or her view of the opposite gender. Instead, they are primarily exposed to two groups: </span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_q2kh1r3xrpav-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The kind of opposite gender person who is into the same things as them (that is, on average, women who skew more masculine than the average woman, and men who skew more feminine than the average man), and</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The kind of opposite gender person they tend to date.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The first is a systemic bias affecting most people, the second is a selection effect that operates at the individual level. It&rsquo;s not a distortion in how women as a group view men or vice versa, but a distortion in how an individual man or woman sees women or men as a group. It is still important to be aware of it at the individual level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The most salient example is probably also the most tragic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;ve read it in several places, but I can&rsquo;t find a source right now: &ldquo;The people who are attracted to a gender they don&rsquo;t actually like are among the most miserable people on earth.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>This isn&rsquo;t just about misandric straight women or misogynistic straight men; it&rsquo;s also about homophobic gay guys and lesbians.

A consequence of this was that I ended up on dates with a bunch of people I wasn&rsquo;t really into.

I&rsquo;m also, uh, unresponsive to text messages a lot of the time. My friends are used to me intermittently ignoring them, but for the people I was dating it was effectively the same as running a hot-and-cold game.

I dunno man, I just work here.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.gcq8dyu61srv"><span class="c25 c39">How does the hiring process at Google work?</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is going to focus on the hiring process for software engineers, cause that&rsquo;s what I know.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.wd999odqna1z"><span class="c34">Interview Types</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Every interview at Google is 45 minutes long. The first 5 minutes are just chit-chat, and the last 10 minutes are an opportunity for the candidate to ask the interviewer some questions, so there&rsquo;s only 30 minutes that actually matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There&rsquo;s 3 types of interviews an average candidate might face:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_ti0k6gyrkjeg-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Coding and Algorithms (C&amp;A)</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Googleyness and Leadership (G&amp;L)</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">System Design</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c3">System design is usually for L5+ candidates, and I don&rsquo;t do them, so I won&rsquo;t discuss it. We&rsquo;ll focus more on the other two later.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.3a8rlue06qj"><span class="c34">The Process</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">All candidates will speak to a recruiter for 15 minutes just to make sure they exist and are vaguely relevant. They then go through a preliminary interview. This is essentially identical to a C&amp;A interview, except the aim is to check whether it&rsquo;s worth bringing the candidate back for more interviews, so it&rsquo;s ok to be a bit less strict - you&rsquo;re just trying to filter out the no-hopers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Once that&rsquo;s done candidates will have a series of interviews. For an L5 candidate that might be 3 C&amp;As, 1 G&amp;L, and one System Design. For an L3, it might be 2 C&amp;As and one G&amp;L. Everyone gets one G&amp;L.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If they pass all of that they&rsquo;ll need to be allocated to a team. Sometimes candidates will be hired for a specific role, but that&rsquo;s rare. Usually they&rsquo;ll be recruited as a generic Googler, then they&rsquo;ll meet with lots of teams until both agree that it&rsquo;s a match, and the candidate will get an offer. Anyone who&rsquo;s passed the initial rounds of interviews is considered to be good enough for Google so these meetings will usually focus on what the team does and what the candidate is interested in, instead of technical questions.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.kovgllo9nsf3"><span class="c34">Evaluating the Candidate</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Google uses a structured grading rubric. What that means in practice is:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_d2omzuyrj9j-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The interviewer will write up everything that happened in the interview, but the chances are nobody&rsquo;s ever going to look at that.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">They then rate the candidate from 1 to 4 on a variety of skills - e.g. coding, communication, testing, etc. There&rsquo;s a detailed description of what each rating means for each skill, and they write up a couple of sentences about why the candidate deserved that rating.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Finally they rate the candidate anywhere from Strong No Hire to Strong Hire, and give a brief justification for this rating.</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The descriptions for each skill depend on the level the candidate is aiming for, so L3s have lower expectations than L5s. You can also optionally rate the candidate for one level above or below their target level, if you think they outperformed your expectations, or that they aren&rsquo;t good enough for L4 but would be fine as an L3.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The hiring committee is then responsible for looking at the responses from all interviewers and making a decision.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.to2np3ouged3"><span class="c25 c39">The Coding and Algorithms interview</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is the interview with all the famous Google interview questions. There&rsquo;s a bank of interview questions, and interviewers are expected to pick one they like, or add their own questions to the bank. Questions are regularly removed if they become too popular on LeetCode or similar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The interviewer will ask the question, and then the candidate will discuss approaches, before implementing it in a shared UI. The UI offers syntax highlighting but nothing else - no compiler or code suggestions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Questions tend to be very algorithm heavy - lots will require using binary trees or dynamic programming for example, as well as more obscure data structures like min-heaps. Because most programmers have never used a min-heap in their life, Google recommends candidates bone up on their data structures before their interviews.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I think this is really stupid. If you&#39;re interviewing someone with 10 years experience, and recommend they need to study before they take your interview, that means you&#39;re clearly interviewing for the wrong skills. Focus on things they would actually have used in their 10 years as a developer!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It also means that the result is much more random than it should be, depending on whether the candidate happened to hit on the right approach in the very limited time available. Also because the candidate needs to spend a lot of time thinking, they have less time to actually write code.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Finally the only data structures a software developer needs to know are arrays and hashmaps. </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170906749&amp;usg=AOvVaw1UhrEKmTDDohI3HX5CP_6x">Nested loops go brrr</a></span><span class="c3">. If you have a performance problem it&rsquo;s most probably your network calls. If you still have a performance problem, it&rsquo;s probably something stupid. If your algorithm&rsquo;s slow, you probably just need to sit and think about it for a while because it doesn&rsquo;t map to a neat standard algorithm. If it does you can look it up (or ask ChatGPT).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My advice is to instead focus on questions with lots of different approaches, many of which are within reach for a capable programmer in half an hour, but with plenty of edge cases to handle and follow up questions to ask. The question should be the sort of question that might crop up in real life every few months or so. This gives you much more ability to see how the candidate tackles realistic situations, and how they write and structure code.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Let&rsquo;s give some examples:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">BAD</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Given an array arr[] and an integer k, where arr[i] denotes the number of pages of a book and k denotes total number of students.

All that matters is your comp-sci chops. So how can you use it to distinguish between an L3 and L5?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">GOOD</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c44 c14">Given a number of filepaths, include as much of the end of each filepath as is necessary to uniquely identify it from all the others. So if you have &ldquo;home/app/a&rdquo;, &ldquo;home/app/b&rdquo;, and &ldquo;home/config/a&rdquo; return &ldquo;app/a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, and &ldquo;config/a&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This is the sort of thing that comes up in real life. I know it comes up in real life because it happened to me last week. And I know that there&rsquo;s lots of approaches, it&rsquo;s full of edge cases, an initial solution can be hacked out in 10 minutes, and handling all the edge cases can take waaaaay longer than you thought. And then your reviewer can tell you it&rsquo;s not necessary and you wasted your entire morning. And then it turns out it is necessary, and you have to spend an hour trying to find it using unspeakable git commands. Only to eventually pick a different approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In short, this is coding in the trenches. How you solve this problem tells me what you can do in real life, not your namby-pamby comp sci degree.

Things like:</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_oc9so5btu9fp-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Have you ever worked on a project which failed? Why? How could you have let it fail? Are you just a pathetic miserable excuse for a human? Why do you even think you&rsquo;re worthy to look at me, a Googler?</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">What would you do if you disagreed with your boss? Yeah right? No you wouldn&rsquo;t, you would silently nod and take it wouldn&rsquo;t you? Yes, that&rsquo;s right, you would.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I have no unresolved trauma from my own interview.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Interviewers and candidates both mutually hate this interview. Recruiters hate me giving this interview, because the candidate tends to give me some sort of answer, I nod and say that sounds reasonable, and then we finish all the questions and sort of stare awkwardly at each other for the remaining 20 minutes. I&rsquo;ve stopped giving these interviews.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anyway, I get why these are useful, but I cannot imagine a scenario where I would reject an L3 or L4 as a result of their performance here (except for the weird edge cases like if the guy suggests murdering their boss is the best way to resolve a disagreement), so I think Google should just keep this for L5 plus.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.l9dk9d65akd"><span class="c25 c39">Does the interviewing process work?</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Given how much I&rsquo;ve bad-mouthed the interview process, here&rsquo;s the point where I should come in with hard cold data and show that results suck, the interview process can&rsquo;t distinguish good candidates from bad, the L8s are no better than the L3s, etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t for two reasons:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_7fsa8o9cwbic-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">I forgot all about the deadline and rushed this off in half an hour. I don&rsquo;t have any data.</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The results actually seem to be quite good.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Developers at Google are consistently among the strongest I&rsquo;ve ever worked with. At previous companies I was always the most talented developer in every team. Now I&rsquo;m often not. And the levels seem roughly appropriate - when I find out which level a colleague is (it&rsquo;s hidden by default) I&rsquo;m rarely surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I think the biggest factor is that the interviews act as an IQ test. No-one passes Google interview questions if they&rsquo;re not clever, and no-one passes them if they can&rsquo;t write code reasonably quickly, so between the two Google ends up with smart developers. Smart developers are good. And since levels are partly decided based on experience, and partly based on how well you did in the interview (i.e. how smart you are), and smart people make good use of experience, the levels end up about right too. Plus the system design interview helps filter out poor candidates from L5+.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Secondly Google has a huge pool of talented candidates, and candidates are prepared to put in work preparing for a Google interview. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they miss lots of good hires, or put off people by telling them they need to practice LeetCode for a month before they interview, they&rsquo;ll still get plenty of good catches. This would work a lot less well at a no-name startup or at Walmart.</span></p><h2 class="c45" id="h.llr1tw1aluoz"><span class="c25 c39">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So, what would I recommend Google keep about their hiring process, and what would I recommend they change?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c40 c8">The Good</span></p><ul class="c46 lst-kix_i2udwj7gazl-0 start"><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Structured interviews with clear rubrics</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">A separate hiring committee that sees all feedback and makes a decision</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Feedback is anonymised and doesn&rsquo;t include e.g. gender or other identifying characteristics</span></li><li class="c1 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Hiring for generic roles instead of a specific position.

There&#39;s an intuitive sense of the word&mdash;being valued, being liked, popularity.

It&#39;s the status you get by being threatening, by being the baboon who can beat up the other baboons and so getting first pick of food and mates. Dominance works through fear: if you don&#39;t defer to the dominant individual, bad things happen to you.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Our brains process dominance signals automatically&mdash;a raised voice, a certain type of unbreaking eye contact, or someone invading our personal space all trigger low-level stress responses. When someone dominates us, we physically make ourselves smaller&mdash;hunching shoulders, avoiding eye contact, speaking softly. These responses are so automatic they&#39;re almost impossible to fake convincingly.</span></p><h3 class="c103" id="h.8yp7a0mt905b"><span class="c33 c80 c8 c26">Prestige</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Prestige, by contrast, is a much newer system. It&#39;s the status you get by being useful or impressive to others. The hunter who consistently brings back meat, the storyteller who remembers tribal history, the craftsperson who makes the best tools&mdash;these individuals gain status not through threat but through admiration.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">The tribe pays individuals who help and who have promise with prestige, as an evolutionary mechanism to lessen free-rider problems in groups. Since having people like you and supporting you is useful, this incentivizes individuals to contribute to the group. In prestige relationships, low-status individuals approach high-status ones (rather than avoiding them as in dominance), and the flow of benefits is bidirectional.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c33 c80 c8 c9">Status</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">These twin systems use much of the same psychological machinery and produce similar subjective rewards. Whether your status comes from dominating others or from being admired for your skills, the brain&#39;s reward circuits light up in similar ways. Status elevations in either system trigger dopamine release, increase testosterone levels, and reduce stress hormones. Status drops in either system can feel terrible and trigger anxiety responses.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">The prestige system evolved as humans became more dependent on cultural knowledge, skill acquisition, and complex cooperation. As tool use made pure dominance strategies more dangerous (it&#39;s hard to be the alpha when weaker members can kill you in your sleep), humans increasingly relied on prestige. But we never lost the older dominance circuits&mdash;we just layered the new system on top.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image42.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 335.22px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">So, we&#39;re left with a leaderboard in our head, keeping track of something called &quot;status&quot; for us and those around us. Status can be earned through dominance or through prestige, but is usually stored in memory and action as a single variable; social software is easier if you just have to keep track of one thing. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Status is constantly being determined at both the micro-level through dozens of micro-signals&mdash;indicators of prestige and dominance such as who interrupts whom, gaze-holding time, whose jokes earn laugh-echoes&mdash;but it&#39;s also created at the macro-level by memory of someone&#39;s potential threat and usefulness. In social circumstances, parts of our brain constantly determine relative status, and use it to inform how to act, how to stand, when to talk.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Keith Johnstone describes the micro-level in his book Impro:</span></p><p class="c10 c37 c50"><span class="c29">&quot;If I speak with a still head, then I&#39;ll do many other high-status things quite automatically. I&#39;ll speak in complete sentences, I&#39;ll hold eye contact. I&#39;ll move more smoothly, and occupy more &#39;space&#39;. If I talk with my toes pointing inwards I&#39;m more likely to give a hesitant little &#39;er&#39; before each sentence, and I&#39;ll smile with my teeth covering my bottom lip, and I&#39;ll sound a little breathless, and so on. We were amazed to find that apparently unrelated things could so strongly influence each other; it didn&#39;t seem reasonable that the position of the feet could influence sentence structure and eye contact, but it is so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10 c37"><span class="c30"><br></span><span class="c33 c69 c8 c81">Taskmaster</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c30">For more details on what exactly high and low status look like in practice, </span><span class="c19 c30"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskmaster_(TV_series)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153170938202&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FSXqRt-OWlYQDljx74DXn">Taskmaster</a></span><span class="c29">&nbsp;is a British comedy show that provides a perfect illustration.

Greg is relaxed, stares fixedly at whomever he is talking to, has his shoulders back. Alex looks around, off in space. He sits forward, tucked in on himself, nervously glances at Greg, constantly making fast darting movements. He compliments and adores Greg; Greg constantly insults him. Greg has all the status, Alex has none. Most of the comedy comes from the difference in status between them, and crucially to the show, Greg&#39;s status is amplified by Alex acting so low-status, which makes Greg&#39;s judgments of the other comedians feel much more real and powerful.<br><br>Notably, Greg acts both dominant and prestigious, fluidly switching between threatening Alex and impressing other comedians with a quick joke. Both raise his status in ways that the show needs to function, and I think this helps show what I mean when I say that status is a single variable, that can be raised in two different, but not exclusive, ways. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">That&#39;s a lot of info, but for the purposes of this essay, the important points are:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_p86cl57g0z2c-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Status is earned through two different mechanisms: prestige and dominance</span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Status is stored as a single variable, which our subconscious mind tracks in people around us</span></li><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Status is hooked into the reward mechanisms of the human brain</span></li></ol><h2 class="c99" id="h.5fanj2ftkh3"><span class="c33 c30 c89 c94">The Status Theory of Sexual Attraction</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Now that we have a proper background on status, let&#39;s dive into what people find hot.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">(One quick sidebar: Throughout this section, I&#39;m going to be using the term &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;hotness&quot; a lot. Something that is hot is something that turns someone on, that they find sexy, that activates the part of the brain responsible for sexual pleasure. Someone can be hot, but so can their actions, their voice, the decisions they make, and the way they move. It&#39;s a general purpose term, and I don&#39;t think English has a better one.)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">I&#39;m going to make a bold claim: most kinks and most things that people find hot are based around the two possibilities that status allows&mdash;higher and lower. These two fundamental orientations toward status produce nearly all the sexual preferences, behaviors, and fantasies we observe.</span></p><h3 class="c103" id="h.vml4hbkb6azs"><span class="c33 c30 c89 c26">High Status Hotness (HSH)</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Let&#39;s call the first possibility &quot;high status hotness&quot; because that&#39;s exactly what it is. This is the hotness that consists of having somebody you find attractive servicing you, of making somebody lose themselves in pleasure because of your actions, of telling somebody what to do and having them instantly do it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">It&#39;s doing whatever you want with your partner, whatever makes you feel good, and that act of not caring, of being such high status that you don&#39;t care about pleasing them, ends up being exactly what they want. We can call this being a dom, a top, a sadist, the more active partner&mdash;they&#39;re all slightly different &nbsp;ways of describing being the higher status partner.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Now, as discussed above, status has two main components: dominance and prestige. Some people are more into being dominant, the more sadist/mean dom side of things; others are more focused on prestige, on being a pleasure dom, where the fantasy is being so skilled that you make someone lose their mind and adore you.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">But fundamentally, the important thing is being high status, and sexuality has these two components relatively intermixed. Someone who finds being high status hot, who is normally prestige-focused, will probably at least somewhat enjoy something more on the dominance side of things. </span></p><h3 class="c103" id="h.t50i57s5gew8"><span class="c33 c30 c89 c26">Low Status Hotness (LSH)</span></h3><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Low status hotness is the hotness, the turned-on-ness that comes from being with a high status partner. This is the hotness that consists of being paid attention to, of being so attractive that your partner can&#39;t hold themselves back, of being used however your partner wants (because that&#39;s what a high-status partner would do, and you find your partner behaving in a high status way directly, personally, enjoyable).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">This is the hotness of being a sub, a little, a good boy or girl, of being taken care of, of being told what to do by a commanding, stern voice, of letting go of all responsibilities and obligations, of being so desirable that your high-status partner is 100% focused on you and you don&#39;t need to do anything.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">As with HSH, low status hotness has different versions, based on dominance and prestige. There&#39;s pure submissiveness, of being helpless, tied up, being told what to do and doing it; and there&#39;s low prestige, which manifests as being desirable, of being wanted, of having someone higher status around who is focused on you. Different, but fundamentally similar, both tying into the status mechanisms of our brains; the thing that unites these two subtypes &nbsp;is that they&rsquo;re about being acted on. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">So, to summarize, there are two main types of sexiness the human brain can experience. These are tied into the status system, and each have their own two main subcategories:</span></p><ol class="c46 lst-kix_cpc0y28wigy4-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">High Status Hotness (HSH)</span></li></ol><ul class="c46 lst-kix_cpc0y28wigy4-1 start"><li class="c10 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Dominance-based HSH: Controlling, commanding, potentially causing pain/discomfort</span></li><li class="c10 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Prestige-based HSH: Skilled, making partner feel incredible pleasure, being admired</span></li></ul><ol class="c46 lst-kix_cpc0y28wigy4-0" start="2"><li class="c10 c27 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Low Status Hotness (LSH)</span></li></ol><ul class="c46 lst-kix_cpc0y28wigy4-1 start"><li class="c10 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Dominance-based LSH: Being controlled, submitting, potentially receiving pain</span></li><li class="c10 c27 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c29">Prestige-based LSH: Being desired by a high-value partner, being the focus of attention</span></li></ul><p class="c10 c21 c43"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 332.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image76.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 332.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c64"><span class="c29">Is this turning into a magic system-esque typology?

Bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism are explicitly about power exchange&mdash;creating temporary status differentials for erotic pleasure. The dominant partner performs high-status behaviors (giving orders, controlling movement, administering pain), while the submissive partner performs low-status behaviors (obeying, being restrained, receiving pain).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c81">Threesomes: &nbsp;</span><span class="c29">I think there&rsquo;s some element of just additional stimulation here; if one person is attractive, then two people is twice as attractive. But I also think that a big part of the threesome fantasy is about status; it&rsquo;s quite high status to have two partners focused on you. Imagine the guy who brags about the time that he had a threesome to all of his mates&hellip; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c81">Role-play scenarios</span><span class="c29">: Teacher/student, boss/secretary, doctor/patient, police officer/criminal&mdash;these common scenarios all feature clear status differentials. The appeal comes from temporarily inhabiting these status positions in a sexual context.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c81">Exhibitionism/voyeurism:</span><span class="c29">&nbsp;Being watched during sex typically signals high status (you&#39;re important enough to command attention), while watching signals lower status (you&#39;re paying attention to someone else). The exhibitionist gets arousal from the status boost of being observed.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c81">Cuckolding/hotwifing:</span><span class="c30">&nbsp;These involve complex status dynamics where someone derives pleasure from their partner having sex with someone else. In cuckolding, the arousal often comes from the status humiliation (low-status sexuality). In hotwifing, the arousal can come from &quot;owning&quot; someone desirable enough that others want them (high-status sexuality).</span></p><h2 class="c99" id="h.82pnov8ip24"><span class="c33 c30 c89 c94">The Evolutionary Story</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Why would there be any reason why the human brain would work this way? Why would sexuality and status be &nbsp;interlinked so closely? As is often the case, it comes back to evolution.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Dominance and sexuality started out interlinked. In most animals, dominance comes from males trying to stop other males from breeding. Makes perfect sense; if you&#39;re trying to spread your genes far and wide, stopping other males who are trying to do the same is an obvious strategy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Mature male alligators pick an area of river, and hunt down and kill any other male alligators, monopolizing any females in the area until a new male alligator rises up and kills them. In social animals, such as our ape ancestors, dominance developed into hierarchies, where the individuals have a ranking order that dictates who breeds and who doesn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image77.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Over time, this results in individuals in social species having sophisticated built-in status detectors and motivational systems, so that they can navigate this landscape and find reproductive success. Evolution makes it so that it feels good to be dominant, because now you can monopolize reproductive opportunities, and feeling good is how evolution incentivizes being on top.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Meanwhile, males are spending all this energy fighting each other, testing each other, ranking each other. Females, who invest more resources and time into children than males do and so need to figure out who has good genes, learn to take advantage of this ranking.. &quot;Top of the ranking = good genes&quot; is a great heuristic for quality, because being dominant in a group is a complicated, hard-to-fake signal, similar to many other kinds of male mating displays. </span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image34.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c33 c30 c14 c107">Being high status is a hard-to-fake signal, a la a peacock&rsquo;s tail</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">As discussed before, humans added prestige to this dominance equation, and over time, status was born. Sexuality was already tied into dominance, as it is in many animal species, but now in humans it becomes much more complicated. However, the fundamental principle that being attracted to status is a great evolutionary hack still holds true; being high status is a hard-to-fake signal, and so evolution makes high status attractive, at least for those who are picky, i.e., females.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c30">Now we have a feedback loop. Being high status was already enjoyable for males; it meant more mating opportunities, and evolution incentivized it with positive feelings. But as female sexuality begins to be based around identifying high status individuals, evolution starts to make acting high status, especially in a sexual context, even more appealing. This kicks off a feedback loop, where both &nbsp;sexes are incentivized &nbsp;to play their role, to focus on high or low status sexuality and to be increasingly turned on by it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">This story is sounding pretty gender essentialist: men are doms, women are subs, divine masculine and feminine energy, yin and yang, yada yada yada. But by looking at the data, we know this is an incomplete, inaccurate picture. There certainly is a tilt to who is a sub and who is a dom based on gender, but there are plenty of female doms and male subs. How does this crude evolutionary story explain that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c30">Well, I think it&#39;s pretty simple: </span><span class="c33 c69 c8 c81">evolution is a lazy hack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">High status and low status sexuality may have evolved for the reproductive strategies of each gender, but actually giving completely different sexuality systems to each gender would be complicated and hard. After all, every fetus starts out as female, and the blueprints for male and female aren&#39;t that different. Instead, evolution found an easier approach: give both sexuality systems to everyone (which isn&#39;t too hard when everyone already has built-in status detection modules) and then use hormones to modulate which is more active.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 498.00px; height: 616.82px;"><img alt="=

Furthermore, it neatly explains the diversity of sexuality that we see in the present day. High status and low status sexuality may have evolved for the purposes of male and female reproductive strategies, but they&#39;re not limited to them; nowadays, people can have one or the other or both, regardless of what biological sex they are. Men are biased towards high status and women towards low status strategies on average, but it&#39;s crucial to remember that this is simply an average, not an immutable characteristic of each biological sex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">This explains why, despite statistical differences, we see the full spectrum of sexual preferences across genders. A man can be primarily aroused by acting low status &nbsp;just as a woman can be primarily aroused by acting high status &mdash;it&#39;s just that the biological defaults are set differently. <br>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t think same sex relationships, or the modern understanding of gender fundamentally do anything to change this picture; people on Grindr say whether they&rsquo;re a top or bottom immediately, and the full analysis </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><h2 class="c99" id="h.rvtsl229i1aq"><span class="c33 c30 c89 c94">The Mysteries, Explained</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c29">Armed with this knowledge of status, the two main kinds of sexuality and their subtypes, and an understanding that any individual can have a mix of these, we can go back to those initial questions, those mysteries, and come up with answers that I find to be mostly satisfying.

On the other hand, this theory does explain why it&#39;s these fantasies that are locked in.

It&#39;s a little harder to spot, but still based around status; you have to be very attractive, very high status for your sibling to want to sleep with you despite the incest taboo or, from the other point of view, one person is being low status, degrading themselves by breaking societal norms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c81">Disciplinarian teacher and student? </span><span class="c29">Super obvious status differential, and the tweak of it being motivated by secret love fits in with low status sexuality being about having a high status individual focused on you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">We can go down the line of stereotypical roleplay scenarios: police officer and citizen, doctor and patient, boss and secretary, teacher and student, even criminal and home-invasion victim. There&#39;s not much that unites these except that in the scene, one is high status and one is low status, and the hotness either comes from imagining yourself with high or low status, depending on what gets you going.</span></p><h3 class="c103" id="h.2wuo8xhrzyzf"><span class="c33 c80 c8 c26">Mystery #2: Partner Enjoyment</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c29">Scott notes:</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c29">&quot;There&#39;s the dirt-common phenomenon of people who can only take pleasure in sex if they know their partner is enjoying it too, and the thankfully rarer phenomenon of people who can only take pleasure if their partner isn&#39;t enjoying it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">This also makes sense under the status lens. These are people who primarily experience high status sexuality, but differ on whether they are wired more for prestige or dominance. Your partner enjoying themselves is affirmation of your prestige, your skill in making them feel good, which reinforces your status. Your partner not enjoying themselves is an affirmation of dominance, of being so in charge, so powerful that it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re feeling good or not. Crucially, both are about what you&#39;re doing to your partner, not what is being done to you; this is what makes them both high status.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><h3 class="c103" id="h.newkhraopv7h"><span class="c33 c8 c26 c80">Mystery #3: Hate Sex &amp; Makeup Sex</span></h3><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image103.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c64"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1 c64"><span class="c29">Scott says: &ldquo;There&#39;s people who can only enjoy hate sex, or makeup sex.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">Hate sex: clear, reified status dynamics; the one hating, punishing, being angry is acting higher status than they normally would, by virtue of being more dominant, and the other partner enjoys those higher status actions, despite the anger being directed at them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">Makeup sex: works similarly but through a different mechanism. The preceding conflict creates an emotional intensity that heightens status awareness.

The appeal comes from the total surrender of status and responsibility. The complementary &quot;caregiver&quot; role experiences high status sexuality through both dominance (complete control) and prestige (being needed, providing care).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c69 c8 c81"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c81">Furries:</span><span class="c29">&nbsp;The furry fandom often involves creating anthropomorphic animal personas or &quot;fursonas.&quot; Through a status lens, these personas often embody exaggerated status characteristics&mdash;powerful predators (wolves, lions, dragons) for those drawn to high status, or cute, small animals (bunnies, foxes) for those drawn to low status.

The same status-tracking systems that help us navigate office politics and dinner parties are recruited for our most intimate desires.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 414.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image120.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 414.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">In the quote from Scott that opened this essay, he compared psychology to physics, where the Standard Model works until it doesn&#39;t. Perhaps a better analogy would be to early astronomy, where epicycles were added to make geocentric models match observations. Eventually, someone realized that a heliocentric model was simpler and more elegant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">Likewise, a status based theory of sexuality is a framework that replaces increasingly complex explanations (trauma, &quot;daddy issues,&quot; classical conditioning) &nbsp;with a simpler, more unified model. Not &quot;epicycles upon epicycles&quot; to explain each sexual preference, but a single principle from which diverse phenomena naturally emerge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">It&#39;s elegant. It&#39;s predictive. And most importantly, it helps make sense of human behavior in all its weird, wonderful complexity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8 c81">Why does this matter? &nbsp;</span><span class="c29"><br><br>To some degree, as mentioned before, this is insight porn; great for understanding things, or feeling like you understand things, but potentially less useful in day-to-day life. Status is a powerful framework, but also, if you try to handle regular social interactions through it, I think you&rsquo;ll mostly just be incredibly awkward and weird. Pick the right frame for the context you&rsquo;re in. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">But, I do think there is some value in understanding the links between status and sexuality. In my life, it&rsquo;s made me a better lover. I flailed around when I first started sleeping with people, trying out different things. Some things got better reactions, and so, I started doing those things more, but I had no idea why people liked it when I moved them around, told them what to do, lightly choked them, etc. I could vaguely speculate, &ldquo;I guess being dominant is attractive?&rdquo; but that was about the limit of the framework I had at the time. I knew BDSM was a thing, and realized that I was acting as a Dom, but I&rsquo;m a pretty prototypical Scott Alexander reader; I needed a framework, a scaffold to understand what the essence of being a Dom was, not just a list of traits. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">And so, I constructed one, pulling from different things I had read; this was the framework I&rsquo;ve explained in this essay. </span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 487.50px; height: 487.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image114.png" style="width: 487.50px; height: 487.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">I realized &nbsp;that I had been with partners that enjoyed me acting high status , and I could lean further into that, now that I knew what the essence of status was. You still have to communicate, to try out different things, to see what the specific person you&rsquo;re with actually enjoys; this is not license to assume that there is one universal human sexuality and that you know what someone will enjoy.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">&nbsp;But, it is license to say, there are patterns to what people like, and if they like one thing, they will likely enjoy similar things that hit some of the same buttons. And those buttons are mostly based on dominance, prestige, and status. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Aside from the purely selfish benefits (which are pretty significant), I do think this model has broader implications. For one, &nbsp;it implies that what we consider deviant or unusual in sexuality isn&#39;t actually that strange &ndash; it&#39;s just the status game playing out in different forms. Instead of pathologizing certain desires as abnormal, we could recognize them as variations on universal human status-seeking mechanisms.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Second, it offers a more nuanced lens for sexual education and therapy. Rather than focusing solely on the mechanics of sex or treating problematic sexual behaviors as isolated phenomena, therapists and educators could address the underlying status dynamics. Understanding that many sexual preferences are fundamentally about experiencing status shifts might help people communicate their desires more effectively and understand their partners&#39; needs with greater clarity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Perhaps most importantly, this perspective offers some resolution to Scott&#39;s original puzzlement. The apparent contradictions in human sexuality &ndash; why some people want to dominate while others want to submit, why the same person might want different things in different contexts &ndash; become comprehensible when viewed through the lens of status. We&#39;re not just seeking reproduction or pleasure; we&#39;re navigating complex status dynamics that tap into our deepest evolutionary and social programming.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29">Understanding sexuality through status doesn&#39;t diminish its mystery or beauty. If anything, recognizing these patterns enhances our appreciation of human complexity. Like how &nbsp;understanding the physics of a rainbow doesn&rsquo;t make it any less beautiful, seeing the status structures underlying our desires doesn&#39;t make them less profound. It simply gives us a better map of the territory &ndash; one that might help us navigate with greater awareness, compassion, and perhaps even skill.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c29"></span></p><h2 class="c87 c79 c73" id="h.5agh923qxw6"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><h1 class="c36 c79" id="h.hc6iebd1zjn9"><span class="c24">Identity</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c40 c8">I. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rationalists are fond of advice like this: &ldquo;Keep your identity small&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cultivate a scout identity&rdquo;, which always makes me wonder, &ldquo;What do they mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The term bothers me because I don&rsquo;t understand what exactly is meant by it, nor where the desire to defend one&rsquo;s identity that is everywhere asserted should stem from. The phrase &ldquo;defending one&rsquo;s identity&rdquo; is, I suppose, to be continued with &ldquo;against change&rdquo;. But are people really that opposed to changing who they are? Don&rsquo;t lots of people want to change some things about themselves? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Arguments using identity are circular. Take this sentence: &ldquo;Alice engages in fiery online debates around religion in order to defend her Christian identity.&rdquo; But without the religious behaviors and beliefs that this sets out to explain, why would we say that Alice was Christian? Did Alice conceive of herself as a Christian prior to developing these beliefs? I also think people do not need to defend their identity. If it already is their identity, it seems pretty fixed. If someone approached me and said &ldquo;you are not John Doe&rdquo; (not my real name), I would laugh it off, but if Alice sees an argument suggesting Christianity is false, she interprets that as &ldquo;you are actually not a Christian&rdquo; and gets defensive? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Whenever I talk to someone about my skepticism regarding identity, I am met with skepticism in return: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that people have an identity?

He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3">I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people&#39;s identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that&#39;s part of their identity.

For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn&#39;t. No one would know what side to be on. So it&#39;s not politics that&#39;s the source of the trouble, but identity.

Do our traits or relationships have the same ability to warp our thinking as our ideologies? Do they do so via the same mechanisms? And does it really help you to think more clearly if you say &ldquo;I fathered this child&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I am this child&rsquo;s father&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">II. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s obvious why people want to maintain their relationships. Relationships (most of them, anyway) are net-positive and afford all sorts of emotional and/or material benefits. There are definitely situations where they can become epistemically dangerous, for instance, when a friend did something bad, denies it, and you refuse to believe the accusations, but that follows from the nature of friendships, not identity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For traits and ideologies, it&rsquo;s not so obvious. I can imagine someone saying: &ldquo;it is instrumentally useful to be seen as consistent and reliable by others, so to not change one&rsquo;s belief and behavior too often and thus to maintain one&rsquo;s identity&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not the framing I would choose because there is an opposing force that is also instrumentally useful: being open to (justified) criticism as well as being seen like that. I cannot offer an explanation for why someone would defend an ideology against overwhelming evidence to the contrary. For some reason or other they became way too confident in their belief and now they are trapped in a prior. Having a trapped prior probably makes you feel embattled and proud. From your point of view, criticisms of your position, which has been proven beyond the shadow of a doubt, are baseless, so they feel unfair or, in other words, like an attack. At the same time, you feel proud because you are on the right side. You are good and smart, the others are dumb and evil. If this purely descriptive view feels unsatisfying and you really want a causal explanation, there is the concept of loyalty signaling which explains, say, Alice&rsquo;s religious convictions as a way to signal loyalty to other Christian and to gain status with them. So this essentially reduces ideology to relationships, which again leaves no need for identity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">That leaves traits. Some traits are deliberately crafted. For example, you are athletic because you are regularly working out and, sure, maybe you started working out in order to become athletic. But you didn&rsquo;t want to become athletic to make this part of your identity. You wanted to become athletic because it&rsquo;s healthy or hot or high-status. As for other traits, before we consider something a trait, it needs to have been stable over time, during which time it needs to have been maintained by something other than the pure wish to maintain it. E.g., someone is a late riser simply because, for whatever reason (genetics, too many long party nights at college), they have trouble getting up early, not in order to maintain an identity as a late riser. Similarly, workers on strike are not said to be trying to defend their identity as aspiring lower middle class or whatever. I have never heard anyone claim &ldquo;Vegetarians don&rsquo;t eat meat in order to defend their identity&rdquo;. It seems to be widely accepted that they act based on religious, health, animal-welfare concerns (or, if you are Robin Hanson, because they are signaling). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There is a subset of beliefs about oneself for which I find it more credible that there is a desire to maintain them, namely self-serving beliefs. Maybe I think I am funny, when really I&rsquo;m not, yet I don&rsquo;t unlearn that belief. It feels nice to think because funny people are popular. This is my brain wire-heading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In the cases where I find a desire to defend one&rsquo;s identity most plausible, it seems to be a euphemism for status; a euphemism I am somehow not in on. Or is it really a euphemism? Yes, saying &ldquo;Alice is just not changing her mind because she is secretly seeking some status gain&rdquo; sounds mean, whereas &ldquo;Alice feels threatened in her identity&rdquo; sounds nice and caring, but that sentence can also be read as &ldquo;Alice is just too stubborn to change her mind&rdquo;, whereas the status framing, if you only remove the word &ldquo;status&rdquo;, becomes &ldquo;Alice fears losing the community that is vital for her well-being&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In one of the &ldquo;of course identity matters&rdquo; conversations I&rsquo;ve had, a friend described how he felt more attached to his local football club from home after moving from the north of Germany to the south. He had never been a huge fan, but now suddenly he was surrounded by people cheering for the arch-enemy and his old identity started growing stronger. I didn&rsquo;t have a great response. Invoking status felt weird because if he subconsciously cared about status so much, why did he not switch allegiances to the other team and gain favour with his new neighbors? Because we are just not that cognitively malleable? Sure, but then can you use status to make predictions at all? This is also true for identity, though. If he cared that much about his northern identity, why did he move to the south for a new job, that had not previously been part of his identity? Now I&rsquo;m just strawmanning. Nobody said that all identities trump all other concerns, but it&rsquo;s weird that identity, as the driving force behind religion and politics, caused all wars, but does not determine everyday decisions. My best explanation for my friend&rsquo;s experience is more reductive: Through years of exposure, he learned the association &ldquo;our club wins &rarr; good&rdquo;. Seeing more people incorrectly (from his subconscious point of view) not believing in it makes it more salient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Status provides the more appealing framework because it grounds the behaviors it intends to explain in their instrumental value for mating and survival, which identity only does once it gets linked to status. And yet it, too, breaks down at some point, or rather, on its own it proves too much. Sure, we can all agree that politics and religion are largely status displays, but did you know that people pursue sex only because it is high-status? Fear of death? Come on, obviously people don&rsquo;t actually fear death, they cannot even model a world without themselves in it. But being dead means being a very useless ally, so we need to pretend to fear death.

Or people are complex, they have several fundamental drives, it is not easy to predict how those play out in any given situation, and that is why it makes no sense to lump all behavioral or belief patterns together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c33 c40 c8">III.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">When I asked if it really helps you to think more clearly if you say &ldquo;I fathered this child&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I am this child&rsquo;s father&rdquo;, many of you probably thought &ldquo;yes, obviously&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;being a father&rdquo; comes with loads of moral connotations, whereas &ldquo;fathering a child&rdquo; states the fact and nothing else. If you want to stick to that and reject the moral implications, you might say &ldquo;I fathered&rdquo; and not &ldquo;I am a father&rdquo; (though Alice and I would hope that you better have very good reasons for that). Likewise, looking at the two sentences &ldquo;I agree with the positions of party P&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am a P-ist&rdquo;, it is easier for me to imagine the former being continued with &ldquo;but &hellip;&rdquo;. Only the second speaker has P-ism as part of their identity, while the former does not, or at least has it to a lesser degree. So do I agree that identity is epistemically problematic? No, because that conclusion would conflate correlation and causality. Probably the second person started growing overconfident in party P&rsquo;s positions before they started calling themselves a P-ist. Identity-related speech can be a warning sign of a trapped prior, but not a strong one, and is mostly just a turn of phrase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 661.00px;"><img alt="Meme - Darth Vader: I am your father.

I&rsquo;d never thought about it before, but again, something resonated, that became &ldquo;part of my identity&rdquo; against my will, and from then on I was intolerable about any noise-related issue. Again, the simple explanation is that I was already like that - hence my roommate telling me I was like that. Again, that&rsquo;s not how I remember things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">(The quotation marks are his, not mine.) This annoyed me because I kind of like not understanding identity, but I understood this. Of course, it&rsquo;s a huge deal to notice a pattern about yourself for the first time, to go from &ldquo;noise is bad&rdquo; to &ldquo;noise is bad and also I really hate noise&rdquo;, and of course it can reinforce this pattern. It makes a difference if you believe something about yourself rather than about the outside world. We matter to ourselves, and that is why our beliefs about ourselves matter, too. There is an obvious feedback loop, where your beliefs about who you are, what you like, what you do, inform both your perceptions and your actions. If you think you don&rsquo;t like basketball, you will not try to play it and will not have the opportunity to discover that actually you love it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And yet, in this example, you don&rsquo;t have a drive to defend this belief because it is about you. You are overconfident, not defensive. Coming back to the Scott quote, although he says something became &ldquo;part of his identity&rdquo;, he does not really describe how misophonia interfered with other parts of his self-conception. It is rather the other way around: his self-conception (or, more precisely, his relationships to others) interfered with his misophonia by means of &ldquo;guilt and self-criticism over responding unusually badly to noise&rdquo;. In both these cases, the ideas associated with the term identity seem more confusing than illuminating. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So that leaves us at: people care about themselves, and beliefs about oneself can involve feedback loops.

Up until a few years ago, if someone had asked me to describe them, I probably could have listed a few general features but definitely would have been unable to create an example. Further, if presented with several patterns, some expertly executed and some not so much, I likely would have struggled to distinguish the masterful from the amateurish.

In general, we enjoy decorations, but we don&rsquo;t think too deeply about them, and we can&rsquo;t always tell the excellent from the good, or the good from the mediocre.</span></p><p class="c98"><span class="c3">That said, Islamic geometric patterns as a genre are quite distinguishable from other decorative traditions. These designs incorporate, or at least imply, both translational symmetry (such that a section of the design can be repeated to fill the plane) and point symmetries (exhibited by complex star- or flower-like patterns clustered around various foci). They feature interlocking or interlacing lines that suggest an infinitely continuing weave, as if executed by a meticulous yet imaginative artisan who knows precisely where to bend and twist the threads to surprise you at every turn. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Such creations clearly can&rsquo;t be arbitrary. In fact, a few conventions are generally observed for a design to be recognized as part of the genre. Skilled artists, of course, break these rules to create novel patterns or to address specific contextual demands. However, disregarding them haphazardly risks producing designs that appear incoherent and amateurish. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">To pare it down to the essentials, the first few rules all serve to maintain the impression that the designs are formed by interweaving lines that either extend infinitely or connect into loops. First, lines should never terminate except at the boundary of the entire design. In practice, inexperienced artists often violate this rule by allowing lines to end at intersections, creating T-shaped junctions. Second, lines must maintain their direction before and after crossing another line. In other words, lines should not change direction at an intersection point. This issue commonly arises when a designer copies elements from existing pieces that do not align properly due to mismatched orientations or incompatible angles. They may attempt to fill in the gaps by improvising the connective tissue but end up losing the tussle against geometry. Third, within a single design, lines should only turn or intersect at a limited set of compatible angles. These angles are usually derived from a basic &ldquo;seed&rdquo; angle by taking its complement, doubling it, halving it, or combining angles together. This ensures that any pair of line segments will either be parallel or form a few fixed angles, establishing a harmonious geometric relationship between them and an orderly aesthetic.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 246.50px; height: 238.34px;"><img alt="" src="images/image122.jpg" style="width: 246.50px; height: 238.34px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 291.00px; height: 236.44px;"><img alt="" src="images/image85.jpg" style="width: 291.00px; height: 236.44px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">Highlighted in blue: a T-junction and a line that bends at the intersection</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The second set of rules addresses the framing and scaling of geometric patterns. The complexity of a pattern should suit the size of the surface that it covers: intricate designs should not be used on small areas, nor should large areas be tiled with overly simple patterns. The latter is a more common issue in modern attempts. Another convention holds that when a design features large star-like elements, the border of the design should align with the centers of these stars, with the corners of the canvas also coinciding with the centers of the stars. This ensures that even incomplete elements at the edges and corners retain as much rotational symmetry as possible, avoiding distorted or asymmetric shapes that only appear along the boundary.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 367.89px; height: 294.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image113.jpg" style="width: 367.89px; height: 294.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 143.50px; height: 294.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image137.jpg" style="width: 143.50px; height: 294.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">An asymmetric shape (note the green vs blue regions) created by ad-hoc modifications to the design and a design whose natural border (in white) is smaller than the frame</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">In case it isn&rsquo;t already apparent, the examples of rule violations mentioned above are all from the Metropolitan Museum.

A large number of geometric patterns have been extracted from historical examples and published in various collections, making it easy for a modern designer to look them up and reuse them. They typically recognize that these patterns can be generated by repeating a small unit, like wallpaper. Thus, when they find a design they like, they may cut out a portion and tile their canvas with it. However, the tiling unit they choose often does not correspond to the actual repeating unit, resulting in awkward seams where mismatched lines join at incongruous angles and form undesirable shapes. Even when the correct tile is used, the designer might fail to fit the region precisely. As a result, some may simply stretch the pattern, destroying the point symmetries in the process. Others allow the patterns to be cut off mid-design. A more conscientious artist might try to fill in the gaps manually if the tiles fall short of the boundaries. However, without knowledge of construction methods or an understanding of the constraints outlined earlier, they often extend the patterns in ways that produce incorrect joints, asymmetric shapes, or awkward bends.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t want to accuse the creators of the Met&rsquo;s door panels of falling into these traps, since by all accounts they are skilled artisans, trained in an unbroken tradition and fully aware of what they&rsquo;re doing, while I&rsquo;m just a nerd. But the issue remains: the alterations there created terminating lines and asymmetry where continuing lines and symmetry are expected.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Notably, on this set of doors, the rails and stiles around the geometric design are of roughly equal widths on all sides, which might seem like an obvious choice. However, an artist sticking to the norms of the geometric design would instead accept the compromise of padding around the pattern, sacrificing up the equalness of the frame for the harmony of the design &mdash; an approach exemplified by the following minbar doors from 14th century Cairo, also in the Met&rsquo;s collection.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 363.00px; height: 571.43px;"><img alt="" src="images/image140.png" style="width: 363.00px; height: 571.43px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">A pair of minbar doors from the Mosque of Al-Amir Qawsun</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">One possible explanation is that, maybe these &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are simply common compromises made routinely, even in well-regarded examples of geometric patterns.

Its &ldquo;somewhat uneven geometric pattern&rdquo; is explained as the result of an adaptation from a smaller piece designed for a smaller and more symmetric space, so compromises had to be made. </span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 553.16px; height: 347.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image39.png" style="width: 553.16px; height: 347.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">The center panel of the ceiling.

To be fair, this particular design is a difficult one to adapt. The non-planar surface is inherently challenging to work with, and the original artist made the bold choice of combining nine- and twelve-fold stars on an octagonal ceiling. Stretching and patching together such a design was never going to be easy. But the artisans responsible for the adaptation either did not know or did not care about the aesthetic norms of geometric patterns, as the centerpiece of the ceiling fails even to preserve mirror symmetry. It&rsquo;s also somewhat amusing to consider that the patron likely didn&rsquo;t mind or even notice the discordant details. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Although admittedly I have not combed through the Met&rsquo;s collection exhaustively, aside from these two examples &mdash; one recent, the other from a milieu that had just suffered a major political and cultural disruption &mdash; I have not personally found other obvious instances of wonky geometric patterns. Thus, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that the norms are robust, and the deviations are aberrations.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.3tup8xu0md4r"><span class="c25 c39">How to make it</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c3">I have criticized the wrong methods &mdash; copy-and-paste and ad-hoc invention &mdash; for creating Islamic geometric patterns, along with the unfortunate results they can produce. Yet even copying relies on the original invention of patterns, which presumably used the proper techniques. So what are those proper techniques?</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Serendipitously, they are illustrated explicitly in the following </span><span class="c14">jali</span><span class="c3">, or perforated stone screen, from the Mughal empire, also on display at The Metropolitan Museum.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 319.50px; height: 472.90px;"><img alt="" src="images/image57.jpg" style="width: 319.50px; height: 472.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Notice that this screen actually breaks one of the key rules listed in the first section &mdash; there are numerous three-branch junctions. Setting that aside for the moment, a closer look reveals two distinct types of lines in the design: the first is slightly thicker and protrudes higher, while the second is thinner and slightly recessed, extending and weaving in a (mostly) typical fashion. </span></p><p class="c10"><span>The rule-breaking is partly justified by the </span><span class="c14">jali</span><span>&rsquo;s material and function. Viewed from indoors against sunlight, the openwork window would appear as a web of shadows. Under such conditions, the fine details needed to create an interlacing effect are difficult to discern and could also compromise the structural integrity of the stone. Therefore, the artist is justified in omitting interlacing altogether. Without interlacing, the &ldquo;no T-junction&rdquo; rule need not be strictly enforced, except for aesthetic purposes. Additional lines that create T-junctions may be added as long as they harmonize with the overall design. The thick protruding lines in the </span><span class="c14">jali</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;play this role. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">A keen observer will also notice that these thick lines enclose three polygonal shapes that tile the area, as illustrated below. This turns out to be a hint at how most Islamic geometric patterns are constructed.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 345.82px; height: 125.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image86.png" style="width: 345.82px; height: 125.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c84">The three types of polygons bounded by the thick lines in the </span><span class="c33 c58 c84 c14">jali</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 424.56px; height: 307.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image61.png" style="width: 424.56px; height: 307.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">The polygonal tiling created by the thick lines</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Now let&rsquo;s look at the thin pattern lines. Within the boundaries of each polygon, the most noticeable shapes are probably the five-pointed stars in each pentagon. A closer look will reveal pairs of larger five-pointed stars inscribed in the decagons as well &mdash; one pointing upward, the other downward. These highly symmetric geometric figures make the design visually fun to look at. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">However, I want to draw attention to the fact that all these shapes share the same vertex angle of 36 degrees, with their vertices positioned at the midpoints of the polygon edges. This holds true even for the non-regular hexagons, which enclose pairs of swift shapes rather than stars. Zooming in on the edges, we observe that two pattern lines meet at the midpoint of each edge, each forming a fixed angle of 72 degrees with it. As a result, when any pair of these polygonal tiles are lined up edge-to-edge, we can trace the pattern lines within one tile to the edge, where they intersect and continue seamlessly, without bending or breaking, into the neighboring tile.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 397.50px; height: 143.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image125.png" style="width: 397.50px; height: 143.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">The same tiles as above with pattern lines added</span></p><p class="c10"><span>From the above observations, we have discovered a method of construction. Begin with a set of polygonal tiles that can tile the plane. Choose a seed angle. From the midpoint of each edge of every tile, draw symmetric pattern lines. These lines must be symmetric around the midpoint and form the chosen angle. When a pattern line originating from one edge intersects a pattern line from a neighboring edge, terminate both lines so that they form a single, continuous line. This line </span><span>will appear</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to enter the tile at the midpoint of one edge, turn in a new direction, and exit through the midpoint of another edge. Finally, tile the plane with these completed polygonal tiles. As if by magic, the pattern lines will connect into a geometric pattern that perfectly adheres to the rules of line arrangement.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 442.29px; height: 321.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image133.png" style="width: 442.29px; height: 321.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">Adding pattern line to each polygonal tile creates the geometric design</span></p><p class="c10"><span>This pattern is based on one set of polygonal tiles and a specific arrangement of them.

Additionally, there are numerous ways to fill the plane with these tiles (some examples of regular polygonal tilings can be found</span><span><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_k-uniform_tilings&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153171035997&amp;usg=AOvVaw3GRwrr5xXdea_Nx9djIBMA">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_k-uniform_tilings&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153171036137&amp;usg=AOvVaw1E523iQW4YlaYWis8OUw40">here</a></span><span class="c3">). Given a set of polygonal tiles, various &mdash; though not arbitrary &mdash; seed angles can be chosen. The choices of tiling and seed angles have the strongest influence on the resulting pattern.

The first has a seed angle of 90 degrees, and the second 135 degrees. However the difference between interlacing vs colored tile treatment also gives them completely distinct characters.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">While the process described so far may seem systematic and rigid, there are also non-systematic aspects that greatly increase the variety. For example, observant readers may have noticed that the pattern lines in the decagonal tile don&rsquo;t strictly follow from the method described so far. To achieve the nested star shape, the pattern lines emanating from the edges are extended until they intersect with a second line. This adjustment enhances visual appeal in the largest and most prominent tile in the design. It also balances the density of pattern lines, preventing a large open space from appearing in the center of the decagons.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The special treatment of high-symmetry points is far from the only variation. One major alternative is non-systematic designs that only approximate regular polygonal tilings. These are much more difficult to create. Allow me to demonstrate with one of my own attempts and the sketch that helped me figure out the tiling. The top half of the double door in the Moroccan Court, featuring a large central element with 40-fold symmetry, would have also required non-systematic methods.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 341.62px; height: 311.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image36.png" style="width: 341.62px; height: 311.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 249.50px; height: 309.86px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 249.50px; height: 309.86px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">A non-systematic design combining 12-fold, 10-fold, and 8-fold point stars, and the sketch used to create the underlying tiling</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Still, it is possible to create new and interesting designs by remixing existing patterns or introducing geometric elements that might ordinarily seem incongruous.

The design process was challenging, described by the curator as a medieval ordeal, involving cutting and pasting figures traced on paper with scissors and even plotting directly on the walls, as the designs were too complex and constrained for computer design software to handle effectively. This is just an educated guess, but I surmise that the main difficulty is that the original Alhambra design was for a panel shorter than this one, so the design had to be scaled up somehow. Simply stretching design would look too crude since the component tiles would be very large, while tiling the design multiple times would look monotonous. In the end, they did some clever cutting and pasting, and made it work.</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 420.50px; height: 236.98px;"><img alt="" src="images/image64.jpg" style="width: 420.50px; height: 236.98px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 420.50px; height: 279.99px;"><img alt="" src="images/image119.jpg" style="width: 420.50px; height: 279.99px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c25 c84">The design in The Met&#39;s Moroccan Court compared to a design from the Alhambra</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The original Alhambra design was dominated by stars with 16-fold symmetry (I&rsquo;ll call them daisies), lining the edges and alternating with another type of star in the middle row. The Met&rsquo;s adaptation incorporates more square-tipped stars (I&rsquo;ll call them zinnias). Substituting one star for the other is not particularly difficult in this case, because both stars are the same size and fit in the same surroundings. This substitution created some unexpected effects. The zinnias have lower symmetry (8-fold) than the daisies (16-fold). As a result, the double lines in each petal create cross shapes that emphasize the vertical, horizontal, and 45 degree axes. This visually reinforces the placement of daisies on a square grid. The denser white tiles in the zinnias also makes the wall brighter overall, enhancing the illusion that this indoor space might be an outdoor courtyard.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.ysmgu2rz6nq7"><span class="c25 c39">The hyperreality</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>Umberto Eco&rsquo;s famous essay </span><span class="c14">Travels in Hyperreality</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;about &ldquo;America&rsquo;s obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality&rdquo;, says this about museums that amalgamate the fake and the authentic: &ldquo;This brings us to the theme of the Last Beach, the apocalyptic philosophy that more or less explicitly rules these reconstructions: Europe is declining into barbarism and something has to be saved.&rdquo; The whole essay is a heady mix of wry travelogues and erudite alarmism, which I had a hard time fully understanding (or deciding if it&rsquo;s cool to quote in this day and age), but this visit to the Met actually kind of made me get it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">The Moroccan Court is intended as a magical space. Visitors step through lacy pink stucco arches into a lively courtyard, complete with a gently bubbling fountain and vibrant wall panels. The colorful designs carve out flower-like patterns in dark tones, evoking an airy, shaded retreat just beyond the walls. There are no explanatory signs for each object &mdash; you are meant to experience them on immediate, non-verbal terms.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>At the center of one wall stands a set of large wooden double doors, perhaps inspired by the entrance to a study in a </span><span class="c14">madrasa</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in Fez. Being in an art museum, you wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to open them, knowing better than to touch the artwork. But it is clear in any case that these doors don&rsquo;t lead anywhere, and at that moment, you see through the illusion. You probably won&rsquo;t even notice the flaw in the geometric pattern on the doors, but I think it hints at why the illusion ultimately falls short.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Museums often create spaces similar to the Moroccan Court in their galleries. Most often they consist of an array of furniture and decorative objects from a particular period and region, arranged to approximate a bedroom, drawing room, or study. Visitors are encouraged to engage with the objects individually, aided by laminated diagrams naming each piece along with its origin and date. Walking through such a gallery, you are invited to immerse yourself in the atmosphere, but the display remains largely informative and functional. There are interstitial objects that may initially seem authentic, but visitors are unlikely to feel disappointed upon learning otherwise, as the authenticity of the space is secondary to the authenticity of the objects. The setting simply illustrates where a card table might be placed and how vases and statuettes would be arranged on the mantel. There is no need to believe that someone once lived here, where every detail was planned according to their taste and needs.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>Alternatively, the museum might reconstruct or relocate an entire room, using original objects in their original positions.

However, unlike the Damascus Room, the Moroccan Court had no prior existence before it was installed here. There is no specific Moroccan Court being recreated; the space functions as a hallway connecting galleries, with glass display cases visible on either side. The logic of a true courtyard does not actually apply &mdash; there can&rsquo;t realistically be a study on the other side of the heavy double doors, the stuccoed arches need not blend with similarly ornate walls, and the floor is not tiled in the same scheme as the walls. The Met sought to capture a living, thriving artistic tradition in this space, but I don&rsquo;t think they quite succeeded. It is neither a true spacetime capsule, like the Damascus Room, nor a typical immersive gallery, which alerts the visitor of its informational nature. Instead, it is an amalgam of creations from that tradition, attempting to convince you of the authenticity of the space through a sleight of hand.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">So I think there is another story to be told here. Instead of a triumphant narrative of continuation, there is a quieter story of loss. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">As a historical benchmark for the loss of ancient cultural treasures, people like to point to the Library of Alexandria. But historians have largely debunked the idea that Caesar, Saladin, or the Mongols set fire to it. Instead, I&rsquo;m reminded of a Chinese emperor of the southern Liang dynasty in the mid 500s. In his early years, one of his older brothers &mdash; an eminent literati like himself &mdash; composed an eloquent letter lamenting the literary trends of the day. Anthropomorphizing rather gratuitously, he decried the corruption of good style by his contemporaries: &ldquo;Were it not for its muteness, could the sooty ink be compelled by their brushes to stain? Were it not for its senselessness, could the reams of paper suffer their hands to flutter and crimp at will? Terrible is the sweeping inundation of letters &mdash; how has it come to this!&rdquo; Years later, when the empire was in dire straits, the younger brother had the crown thrusted upon him. Eventually, with the capital besieged with no hope of rescue, he set fire to the hundreds of thousands of volumes in the imperial library, declaring, &ldquo;The way of letters and the virtue of arms both shall come to an end tonight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">Besides the dark irony &mdash; as if he took his brother&rsquo;s disdain for &ldquo;the sweeping inundation of letters&rdquo; to heart and sent every piece of paper up in flames &mdash; I am captivated by the fact that this anecdote and the early communication between the princes survive, in such perfect dramatic contrast. While the veracity of such episodes can be debated, it seems fair to say people are drawn to these stories of spectacular loss, which in a way become stand-ins for the lost cultural treasures themselves.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">But the Library of Alexandria wasn&rsquo;t destroyed in a great conflagration. It gradually lost patronage, suffered from political instability, declined in prestige compared to rival institutions, and eventually met its end in obscurity. In the same way, the loss of an art tradition is rarely dramatic. Most of the time, no stories are left behind. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">However, if you see through the sleight of hand of the &ldquo;living&rdquo; courtyard, if you notice the untidy lines and asymmetric patterns, maybe you will be reminded of the tangible process of making art. Then you might look deeper, past the interlocking tiles and vibrant glazes, to glimpse the invisible polygonal grids and pattern lines beneath, and use them as guides to feel the rhythm and rhyme of this individual artwork as well as the history behind it. In that way, those frayed edges are not merely shorthands for loss &mdash; they are seeds, quietly waiting to resprout in you.</span></p><h2 class="c10 c79" id="h.s1peasvlk5h"><span class="c25 c39">Epilogue: Lingering thoughts</span></h2><p class="c65"><span class="c3">The method I described of constructing Islamic geometric patterns, called the polygonal technique by Jay Bonner, accounts for most of the variation in bare-bones geometric form, that is, how the lines are placed, where they turn, and where they intersect. But of course, there is a lot more to a finished piece. </span></p><p class="c65"><span>Even at the pictorial level, choices must be made about how to develop the lines. The pattern lines might be thickened, interlaced, or erased and relegated to the background to serve as borders of mini-tiles. The choice of color and material plays a crucial role in shaping the character of a piece: it dictates how the patterns are rendered and reflects regional tastes. For example, simple wood panels often favor interlaced patterns, since intersections accentuated by carved wood trims can generate visual interest through contrasting profiles, even in absence of vibrant colors. Among the examples discussed above, </span><span class="c14">jali</span><span>s are typically Indian, while </span><span class="c14">zellij</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is quintessentially Andalusian-Moroccan. Additionally, many geometric designs are augmented by other forms of ornamentation, such as calligraphy and arabesque. So I want to acknowledge that the actual practice of Islamic decorative arts is much more complex than I&rsquo;ve suggested so far, and I certainly don&rsquo;t mean to belittle the craft of the artists who built the Moroccan court.</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">To the extent that I&rsquo;ve been able to create or replicate some of these patterns, the process reminds me of procedurally generated art &mdash; not the kind generated by stable diffusion, but the old school kind, generated by explicitly specified algorithms, autonomous systems, or the manipulation of randomness. As I understand it, there is often an experimental component: the artist begins with a vision, cooks up procedures, sees what comes out, then iterates, refining the method or sampling new random outputs with different seeds. </span></p><p class="c65"><span>What makes my experience of making Islamic geometric patterns feel akin to generative art is the evolution of the gap between the stylistic expectation of an uninformed observer and its evaluation by a creator who understands the creative process. Approaching these designs as a layperson, it&rsquo;s not difficult to identify surface features: </span><span>unterminating</span><span>&nbsp;pattern lines, translation symmetry, regions of high rotational symmetry, rendering techniques like widening, shadowing, and interlacing. But this kind of description is underspecified and unprincipled. They don&rsquo;t pin down the artform enough for you to create new pieces. And when I see a laundry list of rules that say &ldquo;usually people don&rsquo;t do this or that&rdquo;, I start wondering </span><span class="c14">why</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;it must be this, not that. </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">Learning the process and working through it answers many of those questions. Yet it also reopens others, on the other end of the creative process. The mathematical specifications serving as input are divorced from the visual results, and the experience of creation shifts one&rsquo;s priorities. Thus, the evaluation made by a creator becomes different from the expectation of an onlooker.</span></p><p class="c65"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 246.41px; height: 322.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image112.png" style="width: 246.41px; height: 322.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 322.50px; height: 322.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image29.png" style="width: 322.50px; height: 322.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c25 c84">When I first saw this picture of Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the offensive that took down the Assad regime and the current Syrian president, my first thought was genuinely, &ldquo;That pattern on that door isn&rsquo;t right&rdquo;. See the figure on the right for the version generated by the polygonal method, where the parallel horizontal and vertical lines are broken up by an octagon</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">Not all patterns following the polygonal method are considered &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;. Some produce unevenly sized shapes, others create long, straight lines that introduce excessive uniformity. These effects can be predictable or surprising, so experimentation becomes integral to the process. In this iterative exploration, the artistic mind learns more and more of the latent space of the generative system, and eventually the gap between the expectation and evaluation effectively closes. Curiously, that is the moment when I feel the process stops feeling artistic. </span></p><p class="c65"><span>Experimenting with decoration made this clear to me. For what it&rsquo;s worth, decorative arts have a small latent space. The framework that classifies Islamic geometric patterns by tilings and seed angles boils it down to two discrete dimensions. That is miniscule complexity. As a result, very quickly I felt that I grokked the systematic patterns (the ones using tiles based on regular polygons) well enough to predict the outcome. The exercise lost its novelty. Even the patterns themselves began to look dull. The next step was to go up a level and explore the space of </span><span class="c14">processes</span><span class="c3">. So I started trying non-systematic tiles. That felt like making art again. But the gap could close again.</span></p><p class="c65"><span>As a final thought, I wonder if this experience is generalizable. The debate over the virtue or vice of modern architecture has been going on for years on ACX, and one of the baffling knots that Scott has tried to untangle is: what is going on with architects? Why are their tastes so different from the laypeople? One theory is that it&rsquo;s all signaling, be it class signaling by the patrons, or signaling for </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/on-priesthoods&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153171059575&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kv1Jy7uXww9qXKdCsdObK">cultural priesthood</a></span><span class="c3">. But assuming these are genuine aesthetic preferences, as I&rsquo;m inclined to believe, what then?</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">I have a somewhat obvious observation: architects aren&rsquo;t just drawing random shapes and being completely unpredictable to subvert from conventional taste. Their work still adheres to recognizable styles and trends that ebb and flow over time. </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">So perhaps the answer lies in a two-level model of artistic life. The artist begins with a vision and tries out a process. The result may miss the mark or it may spark new possibilities adjacent to the original vision. The artist iterates, tweaks the process, gradually narrowing the gap between expectation and evaluation, but staying in the neighborhood of the genre defined by their process. But once that gap closes, the process becomes exhausted. The artist moves on. </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c3">As they move on, they also leave behind their original vision &mdash; one that often remains compelling to consumers who didn&rsquo;t experience the same closure. In an age when the process is abundant and art proliferates, the result is confusion.</span></p><p class="c65"><span>To push the idea further, in an age when the process becomes </span><span class="c14">democratically</span><span>&nbsp;cheap &mdash; even if superficially &mdash; via generative AI, perhaps we should be less alarmed about the confusion and more about the boredom. Maybe that&rsquo;s where my nagging doubt comes from when imagining the </span><span class="c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-deep-utopia&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749153171061232&amp;usg=AOvVaw0W-LHiMwDsqEe-3deyRPZc">deep utopia</a></span><span class="c3">. Again, as Eco puts it, &ldquo;This is the America ... where Good, Art, Fairytale, and History, unable to become flesh, must at least become Plastic. The ideology of this America wants to establish reassurance through Imitation. &hellip; Thus, on entering his cathedrals of iconic reassurance, the visitor will remain uncertain whether his final destiny is hell or heaven, and so will consume new promises.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c45 c73" id="h.ddelhmvxjqr7"><span class="c25 c39"></span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr class="c125"><div><p class="c90"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c25 c106"></span></p></div><div><p class="c90"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c25 c106"></span></p></div><div><p class="c90"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c25 c106"></span></p></div></body></html>
